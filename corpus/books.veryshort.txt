chapter i 
down the rabbit-hole 
alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister 
on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had 
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no 
pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book,' 
thought alice "without pictures or conversation?' 
so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether 
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble 
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white 
rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alice 
think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to 
itself, "oh dear! oh dear! i shall be late!' (when she thought 
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have 
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); 
but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat- 
pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to 
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never 
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to 
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop 
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. 
in another moment down went alice after it, never once 
considering how in the world she was to get out again. 
the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, 
and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a 
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself 
falling down a very deep well. 
either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she 
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to 
wonder what was going to happen next. first, she tried to look 
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to 
see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and 
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; 
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. she 
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was 
labelled "orange marmalade', but to her great disappointment it 
was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing 
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she 
fell past it. 
"well!' thought alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, i 
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! how brave they'll 
all think me at home! why, i wouldn't say anything about it, 
even if i fell off the top of the house!' (which was very likely 
true.) 
down, down, down. would the fall never come to an end! "i 
wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 
"i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let 
me see: that would be four thousand miles down, i think-' (for, 
you see, alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good 
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to 
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) "-yes, 
that's about the right distance-but then i wonder what latitude 
or longitude i've got to?' (alice had no idea what latitude was, 
or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
say.) 
presently she began again. "i wonder if i shall fall right 
through the earth! how funny it'll seem to come out among the 
people that walk with their heads downward! the antipathies, i 
think-' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this 
time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) "-but i shall 
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. 
please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia?' (and she tried 
to curtsey as she spoke-fancy curtseying as you're falling 
through the air! do you think you could manage it?) "and what 
an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! no, it'll 
never do to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere.' 
down, down, down. there was nothing else to do, so alice soon 
began talking again. "dinah'll miss me very much to-night, i 
should think!' (dinah was the cat.) "i hope they'll remember 
her saucer of milk at tea-time. dinah my dear! i wish you were 
down here with me! there are no mice in the air, i'm afraid, but 
you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. 
but do cats eat bats, i wonder?' and here alice began to get 
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of 
way, "do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, "do 
bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either 
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. she felt 
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she 
was walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very 
earnestly, "now, dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a 
bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of 
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. 
alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a 
moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her 
was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in 
sight, hurrying down it. there was not a moment to be lost: 
away went alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it 
say, as it turned a corner, "oh my ears and whiskers, how late 
it's getting!' she was close behind it when she turned the 
corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found 
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps 
hanging from the roof. 
there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; 
and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the 
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, 
wondering how she was ever to get out again. 
suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of 
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, 
and alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the 
doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or 
the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of 
them. however, on the second time round, she came upon a low 
curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little 
door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key 
in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! 
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small 
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and 
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. 
how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about 
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but 
she could not even get her head though the doorway; "and even if 
my head would go through,' thought poor alice, "it would be of 
very little use without my shoulders. oh, how i wish 
i could shut up like a telescope! i think i could, if i only 
know how to begin.' for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things 
had happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few 
things indeed were really impossible. 
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she 
went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on 
it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like 
telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ("which 
certainly was not here before,' said alice,) and round the neck 
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "drink me' 
beautifully printed on it in large letters. 
it was all very well to say "drink me,' but the wise little 
alice was not going to do that in a hurry. "no, i'll look 
first,' she said, "and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; 
for she had read several nice little histories about children who 
had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant 
things, all because they would not remember the simple rules 
their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker 
will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your 
finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had 
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 
"poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or 
later. 
however, this bottle was not marked "poison,' so alice ventured 
to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort 
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast 
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished 
it off. 
"what a curious feeling!' said alice; "i must be shutting up 
like a telescope.' 
and so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and 
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right 
size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. 
first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was 
going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about 
this; "for it might end, you know,' said alice to herself, "in my 
going out altogether, like a candle. i wonder what i should be 
like then?' and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is 
like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember 
ever having seen such a thing. 
after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided 
on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice! 
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the 
little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, 
she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it 
quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb 
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; 
and when she had tired herself out with trying, 
the poor little thing sat down and cried. 
"come, there's no use in crying like that!' said alice to 
herself, rather sharply; "i advise you to leave off this minute!' 
she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very 
seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so 
severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered 
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game 
of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious 
child was very fond of pretending to be two people. "but it's no 
use now,' thought poor alice, "to pretend to be two people! why, 
there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable 
person!' 
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under 
the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on 
which the words "eat me' were beautifully marked in currants. 
"well, i'll eat it,' said alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, 
i can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creep 
under the door; so either way i'll get into the garden, and i 
don't care which happens!' 
she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "which 
way? which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to 
feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to 
find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally 
happens when one eats cake, but alice had got so much into the 
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, 
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the 
common way. 
so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. 
chapter ii 
the pool of tears 
"curiouser and curiouser!' cried alice (she was so much 
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good 
english); "now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that 
ever was! good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her 
feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so 
far off). "oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on 
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? i'm sure _i_ shan't 
be able! i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself 
about you: you must manage the best way you can; -but i must be 
kind to them,' thought alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the 
way i want to go! let me see: i'll give them a new pair of 
boots every christmas.' 
and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 
"they must go by the carrier,' she thought; "and how funny it'll 
seem, sending presents to one's own feet! and how odd the 
directions will look! 
alice's right foot, esq. 
hearthrug, 
near the fender, 
(with alice's love). 
oh dear, what nonsense i'm talking!' 
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in 
fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took 
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. 
poor alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one 
side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get 
through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to 
cry again. 
"you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said alice, "a great 
girl like you,' (she might well say this), "to go on crying in 
this way! stop this moment, i tell you!' but she went on all 
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool 
all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the 
hall. 
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the 
distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. 
it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a 
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the 
other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to 
himself as he came, "oh! the duchess, the duchess! oh! won't she 
be savage if i've kept her waiting!' alice felt so desperate 
that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the rabbit 
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, "if you please, 
sir-' the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid 
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard 
as he could go. 
alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very 
hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 
"dear, dear! how queer everything is to-day! and yesterday 
things went on just as usual. i wonder if i've been changed in 
the night? let me think: was i the same when i got up this 
morning? i almost think i can remember feeling a little 
different. but if i'm not the same, the next question is, who in 
the world am i? ah, that's the great puzzle!' and she began 
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age 
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of 
them. 
"i'm sure i'm not ada,' she said, "for her hair goes in such 
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and i'm 
sure i can't be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she, 
oh! she knows such a very little! besides, she's she, and i'm i, 
and-oh dear, how puzzling it all is! i'll try if i know all the 
things i used to know. let me see: four times five is twelve, 
and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear! 
i shall never get to twenty at that rate! however, the 
multiplication table doesn't signify: let's try geography. 
london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of rome, 
and rome-no, that's all wrong, i'm certain! i must have been 
changed for mabel! i'll try and say "how doth the little-"' 
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, 
and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and 
strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:- 
"how doth the little crocodile 
improve his shining tail, 
and pour the waters of the nile 
on every golden scale! 
"how cheerfully he seems to grin, 
how neatly spread his claws, 
and welcome little fishes in 
with gently smiling jaws!' 
"i'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor alice, and 
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, "i must be mabel 
after all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky little 
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so 
many lessons to learn! no, i've made up my mind about it; if i'm 
mabel, i'll stay down here! it'll be no use their putting their 
heads down and saying "come up again, dear!" i shall only look 
up and say "who am i then? tell me that first, and then, if i 
like being that person, i'll come up: if not, i'll stay down 
here till i'm somebody else"-but, oh dear!' cried alice, with a 
sudden burst of tears, "i do wish they would put their heads 
down! i am so very tired of being all alone here!' 
as she said this she looked down at her hands, and was 
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit's little 
white kid gloves while she was talking. "how can i have done 
that?' she thought. "i must be growing small again.' she got up 
and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, 
as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, 
and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the 
cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it 
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. 
"that was a narrow escape!' said alice, a good deal frightened at 
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in 
existence; "and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed 
back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut 
again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as 
before, "and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, 
"for i never was so small as this before, never! and i declare 
it's too bad, that it is!' 
as she said these words her foot slipped, and in another 
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. her first 
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that 
case i can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (alice had 
been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general 
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the english coast you find 
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in 
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and 
behind them a railway station.) however, she soon made out that 
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine 
feet high. 
"i wish i hadn't cried so much!' said alice, as she swam about, 
trying to find her way out. "i shall be punished for it now, i 
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! that will be a queer 
thing, to be sure! however, everything is queer to-day.' 
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a 
little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at 
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then 
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that 
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. 
"would it be of any use, now,' thought alice, "to speak to this 
mouse? everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that i should 
think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in 
trying.' so she began: "o mouse, do you know the way out of 
this pool? i am very tired of swimming about here, o mouse!' 
(alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: 
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having 
seen in her brother's latin grammar, "a mouse-of a mouse-to a 
mouse-a mouse-o mouse!' the mouse looked at her rather 
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little 
eyes, but it said nothing. 
"perhaps it doesn't understand english,' thought alice; "i 
daresay it's a french mouse, come over with william the 
conqueror.' (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice had 
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) so she 
began again: "ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in 
her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the 
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. "oh, i beg 
your pardon!' cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the 
poor animal's feelings. "i quite forgot you didn't like cats.' 
"not like cats!' cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate 
voice. "would you like cats if you were me?' 
"well, perhaps not,' said alice in a soothing tone: "don't be 
angry about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah: 
i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. 
she is such a dear quiet thing,' alice went on, half to herself, 
as she swam lazily about in the pool, "and she sits purring so 
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face-and 
she is such a nice soft thing to nurse-and she's such a capital 
one for catching mice-oh, i beg your pardon!' cried alice again, 
for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt 
certain it must be really offended. "we won't talk about her any 
more if you'd rather not.' 
"we indeed!' cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end 
of his tail. "as if i would talk on such a subject! our family 
always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! don't let me hear 
the name again!' 
"i won't indeed!' said alice, in a great hurry to change the 
subject of conversation. "are you-are you fond-of-of dogs?' 
the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly: "there is 
such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you! 
a little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly 
brown hair! and it'll fetch things when you throw them, and 
it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things-i 
can't remember half of them-and it belongs to a farmer, you 
know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! 
he says it kills all the rats and-oh dear!' cried alice in a 
sorrowful tone, "i'm afraid i've offended it again!' for the 
mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and 
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. 
so she called softly after it, "mouse dear! do come back 
again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't 
like them!' when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swam 
slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, alice 
thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, "let us get to 
the shore, and then i'll tell you my history, and you'll 
understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.' 
it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded 
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a 
duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious 
creatures. alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the 
shore. 
chapter iii 
a caucus-race and a long tale 
they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the 
bank-the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their 
fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and 
uncomfortable. 
the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they 
had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed 
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with 
them, as if she had known them all her life. indeed, she had 
quite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky, 
and would only say, "i am older than you, and must know better'; 
and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, 
and, as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no 
more to be said. 
at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among 
them, called out, "sit down, all of you, and listen to me! i'll 
soon make you dry enough!' they all sat down at once, in a large 
ring, with the mouse in the middle. alice kept her eyes 
anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad 
cold if she did not get dry very soon. 
"ahem!' said the mouse with an important air, "are you all ready? 
this is the driest thing i know. silence all round, if you please! 
"william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was 
soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been 
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. edwin and 
morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria-"' 
"ugh!' said the lory, with a shiver. 
"i beg your pardon!' said the mouse, frowning, but very 
politely: "did you speak?' 
"not i!' said the lory hastily. 
"i thought you did,' said the mouse. "-i proceed. "edwin and 
morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him: 
and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found 
it advisable-"' 
"found what?' said the duck. 
"found it,' the mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you 
know what "it" means.' 
"i know what "it" means well enough, when i find a thing,' said 
the duck: "it's generally a frog or a worm. the question is, 
what did the archbishop find?' 
the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, 
""-found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william 
and offer him the crown. william's conduct at first was 
moderate. but the insolence of his normans-" how are you 
getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to alice as it 
spoke. 
"as wet as ever,' said alice in a melancholy tone: "it doesn't 
seem to dry me at all.' 
"in that case,' said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "i 
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more 
energetic remedies-' 
"speak english!' said the eaglet. "i don't know the meaning of 
half those long words, and, what's more, i don't believe you do 
either!' and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: 
some of the other birds tittered audibly. 
"what i was going to say,' said the dodo in an offended tone, 
"was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race.' 
"what is a caucus-race?' said alice; not that she wanted much 
to know, but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody 
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. 
"why,' said the dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it.' 
(and, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter 
day, i will tell you how the dodo managed it.) 
first it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the 
exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party 
were placed along the course, here and there. there was no "one, 
two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, 
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know 
when the race was over. however, when they had been running half 
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the dodo suddenly called 
out "the race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, 
and asking, "but who has won?' 
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of 
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon 
its forehead (the position in which you usually see shakespeare, 
in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. at 
last the dodo said, "everybody has won, and all must have 
prizes.' 
"but who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices 
asked. 
"why, she, of course,' said the dodo, pointing to alice with 
one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, 
calling out in a confused way, "prizes! prizes!' 
alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand 
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt 
water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. 
there was exactly one a-piece all round. 
"but she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the mouse. 
"of course,' the dodo replied very gravely. "what else have 
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to alice. 
"only a thimble,' said alice sadly. 
"hand it over here,' said the dodo. 
then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo 
solemnly presented the thimble, saying "we beg your acceptance of 
this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short 
speech, they all cheered. 
alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked 
so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not 
think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, 
looking as solemn as she could. 
the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise 
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not 
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on 
the back. however, it was over at last, and they sat down again 
in a ring, and begged the mouse to tell them something more. 
"you promised to tell me your history, you know,' said alice, 
"and why it is you hate-c and d,' she added in a whisper, half 
afraid that it would be offended again. 
"mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the mouse, turning to 
alice, and sighing. 
"it is a long tail, certainly,' said alice, looking down with 
wonder at the mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad?' and 
she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, so 
that her idea of the tale was something like this:- 
"fury said to a 
mouse, that he 
met in the 
house, 
"let us 
both go to 
law: i will 
prosecute 
you. -come, 
i'll take no 
denial; we 
must have a 
trial: for 
really this 
morning i've 
nothing 
to do." 
said the 
mouse to the 
cur, "such 
a trial, 
dear sir, 
with 
no jury 
or judge, 
would be 
wasting 
our 
breath." 
"i'll be 
judge, i'll 
be jury," 
said 
cunning 
old fury: 
"i'll 
try the 
whole 
cause, 
and 
condemn 
you 
to 
death."' 
"you are not attending!' said the mouse to alice severely. 
"what are you thinking of?' 
"i beg your pardon,' said alice very humbly: "you had got to 
the fifth bend, i think?' 
"i had not!' cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily. 
"a knot!' said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and 
looking anxiously about her. "oh, do let me help to undo it!' 
"i shall do nothing of the sort,' said the mouse, getting up 
and walking away. "you insult me by talking such nonsense!' 
"i didn't mean it!' pleaded poor alice. "but you're so easily 
offended, you know!' 
the mouse only growled in reply. 
"please come back and finish your story!' alice called after 
it; and the others all joined in chorus, "yes, please do!' but 
the mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little 
quicker. 
"what a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the lory, as soon as it 
was quite out of sight; and an old crab took the opportunity of 
saying to her daughter "ah, my dear! let this be a lesson to you 
never to lose your temper!' "hold your tongue, ma!' said the 
young crab, a little snappishly. "you're enough to try the 
patience of an oyster!' 
"i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do!' said alice aloud, 
addressing nobody in particular. "she'd soon fetch it back!' 
"and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question?' 
said the lory. 
alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about 
her pet: "dinah's our cat. and she's such a capital one for 
catching mice you can't think! and oh, i wish you could see her 
after the birds! why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look 
at it!' 
this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. 
some of the birds hurried off at once: one old magpie began 
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, "i really must be 
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a canary 
called out in a trembling voice to its children, "come away, my 
dears! it's high time you were all in bed!' on various pretexts 
they all moved off, and alice was soon left alone. 
"i wish i hadn't mentioned dinah!' she said to herself in a 
melancholy tone. "nobody seems to like her, down here, and i'm 
sure she's the best cat in the world! oh, my dear dinah! i 
wonder if i shall ever see you any more!' and here poor alice 
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. 
in a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of 
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping 
that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to 
finish his story. 
chapter iv 
the rabbit sends in a little bill 
it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and 
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; 
and she heard it muttering to itself "the duchess! the duchess! 
oh my dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! she'll get me 
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! where can i have 
dropped them, i wonder?' alice guessed in a moment that it was 
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she 
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were 
nowhere to be seen-everything seemed to have changed since her 
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and 
the little door, had vanished completely. 
very soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she went hunting about, 
and called out to her in an angry tone, "why, mary ann, what are 
you doing out here? run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of 
gloves and a fan! quick, now!' and alice was so much frightened 
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
trying to explain the mistake it had made. 
"he took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 
"how surprised he'll be when he finds out who i am! but i'd 
better take him his fan and gloves-that is, if i can find them.' 
as she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door 
of which was a bright brass plate with the name "w. rabbit' 
engraved upon it. she went in without knocking, and hurried 
upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann, 
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and 
gloves. 
"how queer it seems,' alice said to herself, "to be going 
messages for a rabbit! i suppose dinah'll be sending me on 
messages next!' and she began fancying the sort of thing that 
would happen: ""miss alice! come here directly, and get ready 
for your walk!" "coming in a minute, nurse! but i've got to see 
that the mouse doesn't get out." only i don't think,' alice went 
on, "that they'd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering 
people about like that!' 
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with 
a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two 
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and 
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when 
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- 
glass. there was no label this time with the words "drink me,' 
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. "i know 
something interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 
"whenever i eat or drink anything; so i'll just see what this 
bottle does. i do hope it'll make me grow large again, for 
really i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!' 
it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: 
before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing 
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being 
broken. she hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 
"that's quite enough-i hope i shan't grow any more-as it is, i 
can't get out at the door-i do wish i hadn't drunk quite so 
much!' 
alas! it was too late to wish that! she went on growing, and 
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in 
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried 
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the 
other arm curled round her head. still she went on growing, and, 
as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one 
foot up the chimney, and said to herself "now i can do no more, 
whatever happens. what will become of me?' 
luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full 
effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, 
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting 
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. 
"it was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor alice, "when one 
wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about 
by mice and rabbits. i almost wish i hadn't gone down that 
rabbit-hole-and yet-and yet-it's rather curious, you know, 
this sort of life! i do wonder what can have happened to me! 
when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied that kind of thing 
never happened, and now here i am in the middle of one! there 
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! and when 
i grow up, i'll write one-but i'm grown up now,' she added in a 
sorrowful tone; "at least there's no room to grow up any more 
here.' 
"but then,' thought alice, "shall i never get any older than i 
am now? that'll be a comfort, one way-never to be an old woman- 
but then-always to have lessons to learn! oh, i shouldn't like that!' 
"oh, you foolish alice!' she answered herself. "how can you 
learn lessons in here? why, there's hardly room for you, and no 
room at all for any lesson-books!' 
and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, 
and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few 
minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. 
"mary ann! mary ann!' said the voice. "fetch me my gloves 
this moment!' then came a little pattering of feet on the 
stairs. alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and 
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she 
was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no 
reason to be afraid of it. 
presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; 
but, as the door opened inwards, and alice's elbow was pressed 
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it 
say to itself "then i'll go round and get in at the window.' 
"that you won't' thought alice, and, after waiting till she 
fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly 
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not 
get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, 
and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was 
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something 
of the sort. 
next came an angry voice-the rabbit's-"pat! pat! where are 
you?' and then a voice she had never heard before, "sure then 
i'm here! digging for apples, yer honour!' 
"digging for apples, indeed!' said the rabbit angrily. "here! 
come and help me out of this!' (sounds of more broken glass.) 
"now tell me, pat, what's that in the window?' 
"sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (he pronounced it "arrum.') 
"an arm, you goose! who ever saw one that size? why, it 
fills the whole window!' 
"sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.' 
"well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it 
away!' 
there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear 
whispers now and then; such as, "sure, i don't like it, yer 
honour, at all, at all!' "do as i tell you, you coward!' and at 
last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in 
the air. this time there were two little shrieks, and more 
sounds of broken glass. "what a number of cucumber-frames there 
must be!' thought alice. "i wonder what they'll do next! as for 
pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could! i'm sure i 
don't want to stay in here any longer!' 
she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at 
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a 
good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: 
"where's the other ladder?-why, i hadn't to bring but one; 
bill's got the other-bill! fetch it here, lad!-here, put 'em up 
at this corner-no, tie 'em together first-they don't reach half 
high enough yet-oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular- 
here, bill! catch hold of this rope-will the roof bear?-mind 
that loose slate-oh, it's coming down! heads below!' (a loud 
crash)-"now, who did that?-it was bill, i fancy-who's to go 
down the chimney?-nay, i shan't! you do it!-that i won't, 
then!-bill's to go down-here, bill! the master says you're to 
go down the chimney!' 
"oh! so bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said 
alice to herself. "shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! 
i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is 
narrow, to be sure; but i think i can kick a little!' 
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and 
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what 
sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close 
above her: then, saying to herself "this is bill,' she gave one 
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. 
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of "there goes 
bill!' then the rabbit's voice along-"catch him, you by the 
hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices-"hold 
up his head-brandy now-don't choke him-how was it, old fellow? 
what happened to you? tell us all about it!' 
last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ("that's bill,' 
thought alice,) "well, i hardly know-no more, thank ye; i'm 
better now-but i'm a deal too flustered to tell you-all i know 
is, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goes 
like a sky-rocket!' 
"so you did, old fellow!' said the others. 
"we must burn the house down!' said the rabbit's voice; and 
alice called out as loud as she could, "if you do. i'll set 
dinah at you!' 
there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to 
herself, "i wonder what they will do next! if they had any 
sense, they'd take the roof off.' after a minute or two, they 
began moving about again, and alice heard the rabbit say, "a 
barrowful will do, to begin with.' 
"a barrowful of what?' thought alice; but she had not long to 
doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came 
rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. 
"i'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 
"you'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead 
silence. 
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all 
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright 
idea came into her head. "if i eat one of these cakes,' she 
thought, "it's sure to make some change in my size; and as it 
can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, i 
suppose.' 
so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find 
that she began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small 
enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and 
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. 
the poor little lizard, bill, was in the middle, being held up by 
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. 
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared; but she 
ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a 
thick wood. 
"the first thing i've got to do,' said alice to herself, as she 
wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; 
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. 
i think that will be the best plan.' 
it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and 
simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the 
smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering 
about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over 
her head made her look up in a great hurry. 
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round 
eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 
"poor little thing!' said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried 
hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the 
time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it 
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. 
hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of 
stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped 
into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, 
and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then alice 
dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run 
over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy 
made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in 
its hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was very 
like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every 
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle 
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the 
stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long 
way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat 
down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its 
mouth, and its great eyes half shut. 
this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; 
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out 
of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the 
distance. 
"and yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said alice, as she 
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself 
with one of the leaves: "i should have liked teaching it tricks 
very much, if-if i'd only been the right size to do it! oh 
dear! i'd nearly forgotten that i've got to grow up again! let 
me see-how is it to be managed? i suppose i ought to eat or 
drink something or other; but the great question is, what?' 
the great question certainly was, what? alice looked all round 
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see 
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under 
the circumstances. there was a large mushroom growing near her, 
about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under 
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her 
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. 
she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of 
the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large 
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, 
quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice 
of her or of anything else. 
chapter v 
advice from a caterpillar 
the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in 
silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. 
"who are you?' said the caterpillar. 
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice 
replied, rather shyly, "i-i hardly know, sir, just at present- 
at least i know who i was when i got up this morning, but i think 
i must have been changed several times since then.' 
"what do you mean by that?' said the caterpillar sternly. 
"explain yourself!' 
"i can't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir' said alice, "because 
i'm not myself, you see.' 
"i don't see,' said the caterpillar. 
"i'm afraid i can't put it more clearly,' alice replied very 
politely, "for i can't understand it myself to begin with; and 
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.' 
"it isn't,' said the caterpillar. 
"well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said alice; "but 
when you have to turn into a chrysalis-you will some day, you 
know-and then after that into a butterfly, i should think you'll 
feel it a little queer, won't you?' 
"not a bit,' said the caterpillar. 
"well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said alice; 
"all i know is, it would feel very queer to me.' 
"you!' said the caterpillar contemptuously. "who are you?' 
which brought them back again to the beginning of the 
conversation. alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar's 
making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, 
very gravely, "i think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.' 
"why?' said the caterpillar. 
here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not 
think of any good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in 
a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. 
"come back!' the caterpillar called after her. "i've something 
important to say!' 
this sounded promising, certainly: alice turned and came back 
again. 
"keep your temper,' said the caterpillar. 
"is that all?' said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as 
she could. 
"no,' said the caterpillar. 
alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else 
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth 
hearing. for some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but 
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth 
again, and said, "so you think you're changed, do you?' 
"i'm afraid i am, sir,' said alice; "i can't remember things as 
i used-and i don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!' 
"can't remember what things?' said the caterpillar. 
"well, i've tried to say "how doth the little busy bee," but it 
all came different!' alice replied in a very melancholy voice. 
"repeat, "you are old, father william,"' said the caterpillar. 
alice folded her hands, and began:- 
"you are old, father william,' the young man said, 
"and your hair has become very white; 
and yet you incessantly stand on your head- 
do you think, at your age, it is right?' 
"in my youth,' father william replied to his son, 
"i feared it might injure the brain; 
but, now that i'm perfectly sure i have none, 
why, i do it again and again.' 
"you are old,' said the youth, "as i mentioned before, 
and have grown most uncommonly fat; 
yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door- 
pray, what is the reason of that?' 
"in my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, 
"i kept all my limbs very supple 
by the use of this ointment-one shilling the box- 
allow me to sell you a couple?' 
"you are old,' said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak 
for anything tougher than suet; 
yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak- 
pray how did you manage to do it?' 
"in my youth,' said his father, "i took to the law, 
and argued each case with my wife; 
and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, 
has lasted the rest of my life.' 
"you are old,' said the youth, "one would hardly suppose 
that your eye was as steady as ever; 
yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose- 
what made you so awfully clever?' 
"i have answered three questions, and that is enough,' 
said his father; "don't give yourself airs! 
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff? 
be off, or i'll kick you down stairs!' 
"that is not said right,' said the caterpillar. 
"not quite right, i'm afraid,' said alice, timidly; "some of the 
words have got altered.' 
"it is wrong from beginning to end,' said the caterpillar 
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. 
the caterpillar was the first to speak. 
"what size do you want to be?' it asked. 
"oh, i'm not particular as to size,' alice hastily replied; 
"only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.' 
"i don't know,' said the caterpillar. 
alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in 
her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. 
"are you content now?' said the caterpillar. 
"well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you 
wouldn't mind,' said alice: "three inches is such a wretched 
height to be.' 
"it is a very good height indeed!' said the caterpillar 
angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three 
inches high). 
"but i'm not used to it!' pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone. 
and she thought of herself, "i wish the creatures wouldn't be so 
easily offended!' 
"you'll get used to it in time,' said the caterpillar; and it 
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. 
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. 
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. then it got 
down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely 
remarking as it went, "one side will make you grow taller, and 
the other side will make you grow shorter.' 
"one side of what? the other side of what?' thought alice to 
herself. 
"of the mushroom,' said the caterpillar, just as if she had 
asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. 
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a 
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as 
it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. 
however, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they 
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. 
"and now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a 
little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment 
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her 
foot! 
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but 
she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking 
rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. 
her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was 
hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and 
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. 
"come, my head's free at last!' said alice in a tone of 
delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she 
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could 
see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay 
far below her. 
"what can all that green stuff be?' said alice. "and where 
have my shoulders got to? and oh, my poor hands, how is it i 
can't see you?' she was moving them about as she spoke, but no 
result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the 
distant green leaves. 
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her 
head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted 
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, 
like a serpent. she had just succeeded in curving it down into a 
graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which 
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she 
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a 
hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating 
her violently with its wings. 
"serpent!' screamed the pigeon. 
"i'm not a serpent!' said alice indignantly. "let me alone!' 
"serpent, i say again!' repeated the pigeon, but in a more 
subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, "i've tried every 
way, and nothing seems to suit them!' 
"i haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said 
alice. 
"i've tried the roots of trees, and i've tried banks, and i've 
tried hedges,' the pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but 
those serpents! there's no pleasing them!' 
alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no 
use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished. 
"as if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the 
pigeon; "but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and 
day! why, i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' 
"i'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said alice, who was 
beginning to see its meaning. 
"and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued 
the pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as i was 
thinking i should be free of them at last, they must needs come 
wriggling down from the sky! ugh, serpent!' 
"but i'm not a serpent, i tell you!' said alice. "i'm a-i'm 
a-' 
"well! what are you?' said the pigeon. "i can see you're 
trying to invent something!' 
"i-i'm a little girl,' said alice, rather doubtfully, as she 
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. 
"a likely story indeed!' said the pigeon in a tone of the 
deepest contempt. "i've seen a good many little girls in my 
time, but never one with such a neck as that! no, no! you're a 
serpent; and there's no use denying it. i suppose you'll be 
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' 
"i have tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, who was a very 
truthful child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as 
serpents do, you know.' 
"i don't believe it,' said the pigeon; "but if they do, why 
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all i can say.' 
this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent 
for a minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of 
adding, "you're looking for eggs, i know that well enough; and 
what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a 
serpent?' 
"it matters a good deal to me,' said alice hastily; "but i'm 
not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn't 
want yours: i don't like them raw.' 
"well, be off, then!' said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it 
settled down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the 
trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled 
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and 
untwist it. after a while she remembered that she still held the 
pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very 
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and 
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had 
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. 
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, 
that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a 
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. "come, 
there's half my plan done now! how puzzling all these changes 
are! i'm never sure what i'm going to be, from one minute to 
another! however, i've got back to my right size: the next 
thing is, to get into that beautiful garden-how is that to be 
done, i wonder?' as she said this, she came suddenly upon an 
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 
"whoever lives there,' thought alice, "it'll never do to come 
upon them this size: why, i should frighten them out of their 
wits!' so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did 
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself 
down to nine inches high. 
chapter vi 
pig and pepper 
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and 
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came 
running out of the wood-(she considered him to be a footman 
because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, 
she would have called him a fish)-and rapped loudly at the door 
with his knuckles. it was opened by another footman in livery, 
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, 
alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their 
heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all about, and 
crept a little way out of the wood to listen. 
the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great 
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to 
the other, saying, in a solemn tone, "for the duchess. an 
invitation from the queen to play croquet.' the frog-footman 
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the 
words a little, "from the queen. an invitation for the duchess 
to play croquet.' 
then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled 
together. 
alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into 
the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped 
out the fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the 
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. 
alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. 
"there's no sort of use in knocking,' said the footman, "and 
that for two reasons. first, because i'm on the same side of the 
door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise 
inside, no one could possibly hear you.' and certainly there was 
a most extraordinary noise going on within-a constant howling 
and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish 
or kettle had been broken to pieces. 
"please, then,' said alice, "how am i to get in?' 
"there might be some sense in your knocking,' the footman went 
on without attending to her, "if we had the door between us. for 
instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and i could let 
you out, you know.' he was looking up into the sky all the time 
he was speaking, and this alice thought decidedly uncivil. "but 
perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; "his eyes are so 
very nearly at the top of his head. but at any rate he might 
answer questions.-how am i to get in?' she repeated, aloud. 
"i shall sit here,' the footman remarked, "till tomorrow-' 
at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate 
came skimming out, straight at the footman's head: it just 
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees 
behind him. 
"-or next day, maybe,' the footman continued in the same tone, 
exactly as if nothing had happened. 
"how am i to get in?' asked alice again, in a louder tone. 
"are you to get in at all?' said the footman. "that's the 
first question, you know.' 
it was, no doubt: only alice did not like to be told so. 
"it's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, "the way all the 
creatures argue. it's enough to drive one crazy!' 
the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for 
repeating his remark, with variations. "i shall sit here,' he 
said, "on and off, for days and days.' 
"but what am i to do?' said alice. 
"anything you like,' said the footman, and began whistling. 
"oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said alice desperately: 
"he's perfectly idiotic!' and she opened the door and went in. 
the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of 
smoke from one end to the other: the duchess was sitting on a 
three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was 
leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to 
be full of soup. 
"there's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' alice said to 
herself, as well as she could for sneezing. 
there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the 
duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was 
sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. the 
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, 
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from 
ear to ear. 
"please would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, for 
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to 
speak first, "why your cat grins like that?' 
"it's a cheshire cat,' said the duchess, "and that's why. pig!' 
she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice 
quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed 
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on 
again:- 
"i didn't know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i 
didn't know that cats could grin.' 
"they all can,' said the duchess; "and most of 'em do.' 
"i don't know of any that do,' alice said very politely, 
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. 
"you don't know much,' said the duchess; "and that's a fact.' 
alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought 
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of 
conversation. while she was trying to fix on one, the cook took 
the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work 
throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby 
the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, 
plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of them even when 
they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it 
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. 
"oh, please mind what you're doing!' cried alice, jumping up 
and down in an agony of terror. "oh, there goes his precious 
nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very 
nearly carried it off. 
"if everybody minded their own business,' the duchess said in a 
hoarse growl, "the world would go round a deal faster than it 
does.' 
"which would not be an advantage,' said alice, who felt very 
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her 
knowledge. "just think of what work it would make with the day 
and night! you see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn 
round on its axis-' 
"talking of axes,' said the duchess, "chop off her head!' 
alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant 
to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and 
seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: "twenty-four 
hours, i think; or is it twelve? i-' 
"oh, don't bother me,' said the duchess; "i never could abide 
figures!' and with that she began nursing her child again, 
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a 
violent shake at the end of every line: 
"speak roughly to your little boy, 
and beat him when he sneezes: 
he only does it to annoy, 
because he knows it teases.' 
chorus. 
(in which the cook and the baby joined):- 
"wow! wow! wow!' 
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept 
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing 
howled so, that alice could hardly hear the words:- 
"i speak severely to my boy, 
i beat him when he sneezes; 
for he can thoroughly enjoy 
the pepper when he pleases!' 
chorus. 
"wow! wow! wow!' 
"here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the duchess said 
to alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. "i must go and 
get ready to play croquet with the queen,' and she hurried out of 
the room. the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, 
but it just missed her. 
alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- 
shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all 
directions, "just like a star-fish,' thought alice. the poor 
little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, 
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, 
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much 
as she could do to hold it. 
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, 
(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep 
tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its 
undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. "if i 
don't take this child away with me,' thought alice, "they're sure 
to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it 
behind?' she said the last words out loud, and the little thing 
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). "don't 
grunt,' said alice; "that's not at all a proper way of expressing 
yourself.' 
the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into 
its face to see what was the matter with it. there could be no 
doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout 
than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for 
a baby: altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at 
all. "but perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked 
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. 
no, there were no tears. "if you're going to turn into a pig, 
my dear,' said alice, seriously, "i'll have nothing more to do 
with you. mind now!' the poor little thing sobbed again (or 
grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for 
some while in silence. 
alice was just beginning to think to herself, "now, what am i 
to do with this creature when i get it home?' when it grunted 
again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some 
alarm. this time there could be no mistake about it: it was 
neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be 
quite absurd for her to carry it further. 
so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to 
see it trot away quietly into the wood. "if it had grown up,' 
she said to herself, "it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: 
but it makes rather a handsome pig, i think.' and she began 
thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as 
pigs, and was just saying to herself, "if one only knew the right 
way to change them-' when she was a little startled by seeing 
the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. 
the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good- 
natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great 
many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. 
"cheshire puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at 
all know whether it would like the name: however, it only 
grinned a little wider. "come, it's pleased so far,' thought 
alice, and she went on. "would you tell me, please, which way i 
ought to go from here?' 
"that depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said 
the cat. 
"i don't much care where-' said alice. 
"then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the cat. 
"-so long as i get somewhere,' alice added as an explanation. 
"oh, you're sure to do that,' said the cat, "if you only walk 
long enough.' 
alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another 
question. "what sort of people live about here?' 
"in that direction,' the cat said, waving its right paw round, 
"lives a hatter: and in that direction,' waving the other paw, 
"lives a march hare. visit either you like: they're both mad.' 
"but i don't want to go among mad people,' alice remarked. 
"oh, you can't help that,' said the cat: "we're all mad here. 
i'm mad. you're mad.' 
"how do you know i'm mad?' said alice. 
"you must be,' said the cat, "or you wouldn't have come here.' 
alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 
"and how do you know that you're mad?' 
"to begin with,' said the cat, "a dog's not mad. you grant 
that?' 
"i suppose so,' said alice. 
"well, then,' the cat went on, "you see, a dog growls when it's 
angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. now i growl when i'm 
pleased, and wag my tail when i'm angry. therefore i'm mad.' 
"i call it purring, not growling,' said alice. 
"call it what you like,' said the cat. "do you play croquet 
with the queen to-day?' 
"i should like it very much,' said alice, "but i haven't been 
invited yet.' 
"you'll see me there,' said the cat, and vanished. 
alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used 
to queer things happening. while she was looking at the place 
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. 
"by-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the cat. "i'd 
nearly forgotten to ask.' 
"it turned into a pig,' alice quietly said, just as if it had 
come back in a natural way. 
"i thought it would,' said the cat, and vanished again. 
alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it 
did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the 
direction in which the march hare was said to live. "i've seen 
hatters before,' she said to herself; "the march hare will be 
much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is may it won't be 
raving mad-at least not so mad as it was in march.' as she said 
this, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on a 
branch of a tree. 
"did you say pig, or fig?' said the cat. 
"i said pig,' replied alice; "and i wish you wouldn't keep 
appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.' 
"all right,' said the cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, 
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, 
which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. 
"well! i've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought alice; 
"but a grin without a cat! it's the most curious thing i ever 
saw in my life!' 
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the 
house of the march hare: she thought it must be the right house, 
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was 
thatched with fur. it was so large a house, that she did not 
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand 
bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even 
then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 
"suppose it should be raving mad after all! i almost wish i'd 
gone to see the hatter instead!' 
chapter vii 
a mad tea-party 
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, 
and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it: a 
dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two 
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking 
over its head. "very uncomfortable for the dormouse,' thought alice; 
"only, as it's asleep, i suppose it doesn't mind.' 
the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded 
together at one corner of it: "no room! no room!' they cried 
out when they saw alice coming. "there's plenty of room!' said 
alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one 
end of the table. 
"have some wine,' the march hare said in an encouraging tone. 
alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it 
but tea. "i don't see any wine,' she remarked. 
"there isn't any,' said the march hare. 
"then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said alice 
angrily. 
"it wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being 
invited,' said the march hare. 
"i didn't know it was your table,' said alice; "it's laid for a 
great many more than three.' 
"your hair wants cutting,' said the hatter. he had been 
looking at alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was 
his first speech. 
"you should learn not to make personal remarks,' alice said 
with some severity; "it's very rude.' 
the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all 
he said was, "why is a raven like a writing-desk?' 
"come, we shall have some fun now!' thought alice. "i'm glad 
they've begun asking riddles.-i believe i can guess that,' she 
added aloud. 
"do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' 
said the march hare. 
"exactly so,' said alice. 
"then you should say what you mean,' the march hare went on. 
"i do,' alice hastily replied; "at least-at least i mean what 
i say-that's the same thing, you know.' 
"not the same thing a bit!' said the hatter. "you might just 
as well say that "i see what i eat" is the same thing as "i eat 
what i see"!' 
"you might just as well say,' added the march hare, "that "i 
like what i get" is the same thing as "i get what i like"!' 
"you might just as well say,' added the dormouse, who seemed to 
be talking in his sleep, "that "i breathe when i sleep" is the 
same thing as "i sleep when i breathe"!' 
"it is the same thing with you,' said the hatter, and here the 
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, 
while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and 
writing-desks, which wasn't much. 
the hatter was the first to break the silence. "what day of 
the month is it?' he said, turning to alice: he had taken his 
watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking 
it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. 
alice considered a little, and then said "the fourth.' 
"two days wrong!' sighed the hatter. "i told you butter 
wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the march 
hare. 
"it was the best butter,' the march hare meekly replied. 
"yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the hatter 
grumbled: "you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' 
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then 
he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he 
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, "it 
was the best butter, you know.' 
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 
"what a funny watch!' she remarked. "it tells the day of the 
month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 
"why should it?' muttered the hatter. "does your watch tell 
you what year it is?' 
"of course not,' alice replied very readily: "but that's 
because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' 
"which is just the case with mine,' said the hatter. 
alice felt dreadfully puzzled. the hatter's remark seemed to 
have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. 
"i don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she 
could. 
"the dormouse is asleep again,' said the hatter, and he poured 
a little hot tea upon its nose. 
the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without 
opening its eyes, "of course, of course; just what i was going to 
remark myself.' 
"have you guessed the riddle yet?' the hatter said, turning to 
alice again. 
"no, i give it up,' alice replied: "what's the answer?' 
"i haven't the slightest idea,' said the hatter. 
"nor i,' said the march hare. 
alice sighed wearily. "i think you might do something better 
with the time,' she said, "than waste it in asking riddles that 
have no answers.' 
"if you knew time as well as i do,' said the hatter, "you 
wouldn't talk about wasting it. it's him.' 
"i don't know what you mean,' said alice. 
"of course you don't!' the hatter said, tossing his head 
contemptuously. "i dare say you never even spoke to time!' 
"perhaps not,' alice cautiously replied: "but i know i have to 
beat time when i learn music.' 
"ah! that accounts for it,' said the hatter. "he won't stand 
beating. now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do 
almost anything you liked with the clock. for instance, suppose 
it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: 
you'd only have to whisper a hint to time, and round goes the 
clock in a twinkling! half-past one, time for dinner!' 
("i only wish it was,' the march hare said to itself in a 
whisper.) 
"that would be grand, certainly,' said alice thoughtfully: 
"but then-i shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' 
"not at first, perhaps,' said the hatter: "but you could keep 
it to half-past one as long as you liked.' 
"is that the way you manage?' alice asked. 
the hatter shook his head mournfully. "not i!' he replied. 
"we quarrelled last march-just before he went mad, you know-' 
(pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare,) "-it was at the 
great concert given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing 
"twinkle, twinkle, little bat! 
how i wonder what you're at!" 
you know the song, perhaps?' 
"i've heard something like it,' said alice. 
"it goes on, you know,' the hatter continued, "in this way:- 
"up above the world you fly, 
like a tea-tray in the sky. 
twinkle, twinkle-"' 
here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 
"twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle-' and went on so long that 
they had to pinch it to make it stop. 
"well, i'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the hatter, 
"when the queen jumped up and bawled out, "he's murdering the 
time! off with his head!"' 
"how dreadfully savage!' exclaimed alice. 
"and ever since that,' the hatter went on in a mournful tone, 
"he won't do a thing i ask! it's always six o'clock now.' 
a bright idea came into alice's head. "is that the reason so 
many tea-things are put out here?' she asked. 
"yes, that's it,' said the hatter with a sigh: "it's always 
tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.' 
"then you keep moving round, i suppose?' said alice. 
"exactly so,' said the hatter: "as the things get used up.' 
"but what happens when you come to the beginning again?' alice 
ventured to ask. 
"suppose we change the subject,' the march hare interrupted, 
yawning. "i'm getting tired of this. i vote the young lady 
tells us a story.' 
"i'm afraid i don't know one,' said alice, rather alarmed at 
the proposal. 
"then the dormouse shall!' they both cried. "wake up, 
dormouse!' and they pinched it on both sides at once. 
the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. "i wasn't asleep,' he 
said in a hoarse, feeble voice: "i heard every word you fellows 
were saying.' 
"tell us a story!' said the march hare. 
"yes, please do!' pleaded alice. 
"and be quick about it,' added the hatter, "or you'll be asleep 
again before it's done.' 
"once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the 
dormouse began in a great hurry; "and their names were elsie, 
lacie, and tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well-' 
"what did they live on?' said alice, who always took a great 
interest in questions of eating and drinking. 
"they lived on treacle,' said the dormouse, after thinking a 
minute or two. 
"they couldn't have done that, you know,' alice gently 
remarked; "they'd have been ill.' 
"so they were,' said the dormouse; "very ill.' 
alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways 
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went 
on: "but why did they live at the bottom of a well?' 
"take some more tea,' the march hare said to alice, very 
earnestly. 
"i've had nothing yet,' alice replied in an offended tone, "so 
i can't take more.' 
"you mean you can't take less,' said the hatter: "it's very 
easy to take more than nothing.' 
"nobody asked your opinion,' said alice. 
"who's making personal remarks now?' the hatter asked 
triumphantly. 
alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped 
herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the 
dormouse, and repeated her question. "why did they live at the 
bottom of a well?' 
the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and 
then said, "it was a treacle-well.' 
"there's no such thing!' alice was beginning very angrily, but 
the hatter and the march hare went "sh! sh!' and the dormouse 
sulkily remarked, "if you can't be civil, you'd better finish the 
story for yourself.' 
"no, please go on!' alice said very humbly; "i won't interrupt 
again. i dare say there may be one.' 
"one, indeed!' said the dormouse indignantly. however, he 
consented to go on. "and so these three little sisters-they 
were learning to draw, you know-' 
"what did they draw?' said alice, quite forgetting her promise. 
"treacle,' said the dormouse, without considering at all this 
time. 
"i want a clean cup,' interrupted the hatter: "let's all move 
one place on.' 
he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the 
march hare moved into the dormouse's place, and alice rather 
unwillingly took the place of the march hare. the hatter was the 
only one who got any advantage from the change: and alice was a 
good deal worse off than before, as the march hare had just upset 
the milk-jug into his plate. 
alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began 
very cautiously: "but i don't understand. where did they draw 
the treacle from?' 
"you can draw water out of a water-well,' said the hatter; "so 
i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well-eh, 
stupid?' 
"but they were in the well,' alice said to the dormouse, not 
choosing to notice this last remark. 
"of course they were', said the dormouse; "-well in.' 
this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse 
go on for some time without interrupting it. 
"they were learning to draw,' the dormouse went on, yawning and 
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew 
all manner of things-everything that begins with an m-' 
"why with an m?' said alice. 
"why not?' said the march hare. 
alice was silent. 
the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going 
off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up 
again with a little shriek, and went on: "-that begins with an 
m, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness- 
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"-did you ever 
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' 
"really, now you ask me,' said alice, very much confused, "i 
don't think-' 
"then you shouldn't talk,' said the hatter. 
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear: she got 
up in great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleep 
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her 
going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that 
they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were 
trying to put the dormouse into the teapot. 
"at any rate i'll never go there again!' said alice as she 
picked her way through the wood. "it's the stupidest tea-party i 
ever was at in all my life!' 
just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a 
door leading right into it. "that's very curious!' she thought. 
"but everything's curious today. i think i may as well go in at once.' 
and in she went. 
once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the 
little glass table. "now, i'll manage better this time,' 
she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, 
and unlocking the door that led into the garden. then she went 
to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it 
in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down 
the little passage: and then-she found herself at last in the 
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. 
chapter viii 
the queen's croquet-ground 
a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the 
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at 
it, busily painting them red. alice thought this a very curious 
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up 
to them she heard one of them say, "look out now, five! don't go 
splashing paint over me like that!' 
"i couldn't help it,' said five, in a sulky tone; "seven jogged 
my elbow.' 
on which seven looked up and said, "that's right, five! always 
lay the blame on others!' 
"you'd better not talk!' said five. "i heard the queen say only 
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!' 
"what for?' said the one who had spoken first. 
"that's none of your business, two!' said seven. 
"yes, it is his business!' said five, "and i'll tell him-it 
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.' 
seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "well, of all 
the unjust things-' when his eye chanced to fall upon alice, as 
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the 
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. 
"would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, "why you are 
painting those roses?' 
five and seven said nothing, but looked at two. two began in a 
low voice, "why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to 
have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; 
and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads 
cut off, you know. so you see, miss, we're doing our best, afore 
she comes, to-' at this moment five, who had been anxiously 
looking across the garden, called out "the queen! the queen!' 
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon 
their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps, and alice 
looked round, eager to see the queen. 
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped 
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and 
feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were 
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the 
soldiers did. after these came the royal children; there were 
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand 
in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. next 
came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among them alice 
recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous 
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without 
noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the 
king's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this 
grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts. 
alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on 
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember 
ever having heard of such a rule at processions; "and besides, 
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, "if people 
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' 
so she stood still where she was, and waited. 
when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped 
and looked at her, and the queen said severely "who is this?' 
she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. 
"idiot!' said the queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, 
turning to alice, she went on, "what's your name, child?' 
"my name is alice, so please your majesty,' said alice very 
politely; but she added, to herself, "why, they're only a pack of 
cards, after all. i needn't be afraid of them!' 
"and who are these?' said the queen, pointing to the three 
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as 
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs 
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether 
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her 
own children. 
"how should i know?' said alice, surprised at her own courage. 
"it's no business of mine.' 
the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her 
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed "off with her head! 
off-' 
"nonsense!' said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the 
queen was silent. 
the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 
"consider, my dear: she is only a child!' 
the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave 
"turn them over!' 
the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. 
"get up!' said the queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the 
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the 
king, the queen, the royal children, and everybody else. 
"leave off that!' screamed the queen. "you make me giddy.' 
and then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, "what have you 
been doing here?' 
"may it please your majesty,' said two, in a very humble tone, 
going down on one knee as he spoke, "we were trying-' 
"i see!' said the queen, who had meanwhile been examining the 
roses. "off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, 
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 
gardeners, who ran to alice for protection. 
"you shan't be beheaded!' said alice, and she put them into a 
large flower-pot that stood near. the three soldiers wandered 
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly 
marched off after the others. 
"are their heads off?' shouted the queen. 
"their heads are gone, if it please your majesty!' the soldiers 
shouted in reply. 
"that's right!' shouted the queen. "can you play croquet?' 
the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question 
was evidently meant for her. 
"yes!' shouted alice. 
"come on, then!' roared the queen, and alice joined the 
procession, wondering very much what would happen next. 
"it's-it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. 
she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously 
into her face. 
"very,' said alice: "-where's the duchess?' 
"hush! hush!' said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he 
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised 
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and 
whispered "she's under sentence of execution.' 
"what for?' said alice. 
"did you say "what a pity!"?' the rabbit asked. 
"no, i didn't,' said alice: "i don't think it's at all a pity. 
i said "what for?"' 
"she boxed the queen's ears-' the rabbit began. alice gave a 
little scream of laughter. "oh, hush!' the rabbit whispered in a 
frightened tone. "the queen will hear you! you see, she came 
rather late, and the queen said-' 
"get to your places!' shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, 
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up 
against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or 
two, and the game began. alice thought she had never seen such a 
curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and 
furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live 
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to 
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. 
the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her 
flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, 
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, 
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened 
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it 
would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a 
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: 
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, 
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled 
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, 
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she 
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers 
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the 
ground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very 
difficult game indeed. 
the players all played at once without waiting for turns, 
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in 
a very short time the queen was in a furious passion, and went 
stamping about, and shouting "off with his head!' or "off with 
her head!' about once in a minute. 
alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as 
yet had any dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might 
happen any minute, "and then,' thought she, "what would become of 
me? they're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great 
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!' 
she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering 
whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a 
curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at 
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to 
be a grin, and she said to herself "it's the cheshire cat: now i 
shall have somebody to talk to.' 
"how are you getting on?' said the cat, as soon as there was 
mouth enough for it to speak with. 
alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. "it's no 
use speaking to it,' she thought, "till its ears have come, or at 
least one of them.' in another minute the whole head appeared, 
and then alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the 
game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. the 
cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and 
no more of it appeared. 
"i don't think they play at all fairly,' alice began, in rather 
a complaining tone, "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't 
hear oneself speak-and they don't seem to have any rules in 
particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them-and 
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; 
for instance, there's the arch i've got to go through next 
walking about at the other end of the ground-and i should have 
croqueted the queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it 
saw mine coming!' 
"how do you like the queen?' said the cat in a low voice. 
"not at all,' said alice: "she's so extremely-' just then 
she noticed that the queen was close behind her, listening: so 
she went on, "-likely to win, that it's hardly worth while 
finishing the game.' 
the queen smiled and passed on. 
"who are you talking to?' said the king, going up to alice, and 
looking at the cat's head with great curiosity. 
"it's a friend of mine-a cheshire cat,' said alice: "allow me 
to introduce it.' 
"i don't like the look of it at all,' said the king: 
"however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' 
"i'd rather not,' the cat remarked. 
"don't be impertinent,' said the king, "and don't look at me 
like that!' he got behind alice as he spoke. 
"a cat may look at a king,' said alice. "i've read that in 
some book, but i don't remember where.' 
"well, it must be removed,' said the king very decidedly, and 
he called the queen, who was passing at the moment, "my dear! i 
wish you would have this cat removed!' 
the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great 
or small. "off with his head!' she said, without even looking 
round. 
"i'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the king eagerly, and 
he hurried off. 
alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game 
was going on, as she heard the queen's voice in the distance, 
screaming with passion. she had already heard her sentence three 
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and 
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in 
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or 
not. so she went in search of her hedgehog. 
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, 
which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one 
of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her 
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where 
alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up 
into a tree. 
by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, 
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 
"but it doesn't matter much,' thought alice, "as all the arches 
are gone from this side of the ground.' so she tucked it away 
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for 
a little more conversation with her friend. 
when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to 
find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute 
going on between the executioner, the king, and the queen, who 
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, 
and looked very uncomfortable. 
the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to 
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, 
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed 
to make out exactly what they said. 
the executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a 
head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had 
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin 
at his time of life. 
the king's argument was, that anything that had a head could be 
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense. 
the queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about 
it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. 
(it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so 
grave and anxious.) 
alice could think of nothing else to say but "it belongs to the 
duchess: you'd better ask her about it.' 
"she's in prison,' the queen said to the executioner: "fetch 
her here.' and the executioner went off like an arrow. 
the cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, 
by the time he had come back with the dutchess, it had entirely 
disappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down 
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. 
chapter ix 
the mock turtle's story 
"you can't think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old 
thing!' said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately 
into alice's, and they walked off together. 
alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and 
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had 
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. 
"when i'm a duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very 
hopeful tone though), "i won't have any pepper in my kitchen at 
all. soup does very well without-maybe it's always pepper that 
makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at 
having found out a new kind of rule, "and vinegar that makes them 
sour-and camomile that makes them bitter-and-and barley-sugar 
and such things that make children sweet-tempered. i only wish 
people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you 
know-' 
she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a 
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 
"you're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you 
forget to talk. i can't tell you just now what the moral of that 
is, but i shall remember it in a bit.' 
"perhaps it hasn't one,' alice ventured to remark. 
"tut, tut, child!' said the duchess. "everything's got a 
moral, if only you can find it.' and she squeezed herself up 
closer to alice's side as she spoke. 
alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, 
because the duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was 
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice's shoulder, 
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. however, she did not 
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. 
"the game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of 
keeping up the conversation a little. 
"'tis so,' said the duchess: "and the moral of that is-"oh, 
'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"' 
"somebody said,' alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody 
minding their own business!' 
"ah, well! it means much the same thing,' said the duchess, 
digging her sharp little chin into alice's shoulder as she added, 
"and the moral of that is-"take care of the sense, and the 
sounds will take care of themselves."' 
"how fond she is of finding morals in things!' alice thought to 
herself. 
"i dare say you're wondering why i don't put my arm round your 
waist,' the duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that i'm 
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. shall i try the 
experiment?' 
"he might bite,' alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all 
anxious to have the experiment tried. 
"very true,' said the duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both 
bite. and the moral of that is-"birds of a feather flock 
together."' 
"only mustard isn't a bird,' alice remarked. 
"right, as usual,' said the duchess: "what a clear way you 
have of putting things!' 
"it's a mineral, i think,' said alice. 
"of course it is,' said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree 
to everything that alice said; "there's a large mustard-mine near 
here. and the moral of that is-"the more there is of mine, the 
less there is of yours."' 
"oh, i know!' exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this 
last remark, "it's a vegetable. it doesn't look like one, but it 
is.' 
"i quite agree with you,' said the duchess; "and the moral of 
that is-"be what you would seem to be"-or if you'd like it put 
more simply-"never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than 
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have 
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared 
to them to be otherwise."' 
"i think i should understand that better,' alice said very 
politely, "if i had it written down: but i can't quite follow it 
as you say it.' 
"that's nothing to what i could say if i chose,' the duchess 
replied, in a pleased tone. 
"pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' 
said alice. 
"oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the duchess. "i make you 
a present of everything i've said as yet.' 
"a cheap sort of present!' thought alice. "i'm glad they don't 
give birthday presents like that!' but she did not venture to 
say it out loud. 
"thinking again?' the duchess asked, with another dig of her 
sharp little chin. 
"i've a right to think,' said alice sharply, for she was 
beginning to feel a little worried. 
"just about as much right,' said the duchess, "as pigs have to fly; 
and the m-' 
but here, to alice's great surprise, the duchess's voice died 
away, even in the middle of her favourite word "moral,' and the 
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. alice looked up, 
and there stood the queen in front of them, with her arms folded, 
frowning like a thunderstorm. 
"a fine day, your majesty!' the duchess began in a low, weak 
voice. 
"now, i give you fair warning,' shouted the queen, stamping on 
the ground as she spoke; "either you or your head must be off, 
and that in about half no time! take your choice!' 
the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. 
"let's go on with the game,' the queen said to alice; and alice 
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her 
back to the croquet-ground. 
the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence, 
and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, 
they hurried back to the game, the queen merely remarking that a 
moment's delay would cost them their lives. 
all the time they were playing the queen never left off 
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting "off with his 
head!' or "off with her head!' those whom she sentenced were 
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave 
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour 
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the 
king, the queen, and alice, were in custody and under sentence of 
execution. 
then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to 
alice, "have you seen the mock turtle yet?' 
"no,' said alice. "i don't even know what a mock turtle is.' 
"it's the thing mock turtle soup is made from,' said the queen. 
"i never saw one, or heard of one,' said alice. 
"come on, then,' said the queen, "and he shall tell you his 
history,' 
as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low 
voice, to the company generally, "you are all pardoned.' "come, 
that's a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite 
unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered. 
they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the 
sun. (if you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture.) 
"up, lazy thing!' said the queen, "and take this young lady to 
see the mock turtle, and to hear his history. i must go back and 
see after some executions i have ordered'; and she walked off, 
leaving alice alone with the gryphon. alice did not quite like 
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would 
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage 
queen: so she waited. 
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the 
queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. "what fun!' 
said the gryphon, half to itself, half to alice. 
"what is the fun?' said alice. 
"why, she,' said the gryphon. "it's all her fancy, that: they 
never executes nobody, you know. come on!' 
"everybody says "come on!" here,' thought alice, as she went 
slowly after it: "i never was so ordered about in all my life, 
never!' 
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the 
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, 
as they came nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart 
would break. she pitied him deeply. "what is his sorrow?' she 
asked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in the 
same words as before, "it's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got 
no sorrow, you know. come on!' 
so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with 
large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. 
"this here young lady,' said the gryphon, "she wants for to 
know your history, she do.' 
"i'll tell it her,' said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow 
tone: "sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till i've 
finished.' 
so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice 
thought to herself, "i don't see how he can even finish, if he 
doesn't begin.' but she waited patiently. 
"once,' said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "i was 
a real turtle.' 
these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only 
by an occasional exclamation of "hjckrrh!' from the gryphon, and 
the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very 
nearly getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your 
interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there must be 
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. 
"when we were little,' the mock turtle went on at last, more 
calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to 
school in the sea. the master was an old turtle-we used to call 
him tortoise-' 
"why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn't one?' alice asked. 
"we called him tortoise because he taught us,' said the mock 
turtle angrily: "really you are very dull!' 
"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple 
question,' added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and 
looked at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at 
last the gryphon said to the mock turtle, "drive on, old fellow! 
don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words: 
"yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe 
it-' 
"i never said i didn't!' interrupted alice. 
"you did,' said the mock turtle. 
"hold your tongue!' added the gryphon, before alice could speak 
again. the mock turtle went on. 
"we had the best of educations-in fact, we went to school 
every day-' 
"i've been to a day-school, too,' said alice; "you needn't be 
so proud as all that.' 
"with extras?' asked the mock turtle a little anxiously. 
"yes,' said alice, "we learned french and music.' 
"and washing?' said the mock turtle. 
"certainly not!' said alice indignantly. 
"ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the mock 
turtle in a tone of great relief. "now at ours they had at the 
end of the bill, "french, music, and washing-extra."' 
"you couldn't have wanted it much,' said alice; "living at the 
bottom of the sea.' 
"i couldn't afford to learn it.' said the mock turtle with a 
sigh. "i only took the regular course.' 
"what was that?' inquired alice. 
"reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,' the mock 
turtle replied; "and then the different branches of arithmetic- 
ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision.' 
"i never heard of "uglification,"' alice ventured to say. "what is it?' 
the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "what! never 
heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. "you know what to beautify is, 
i suppose?' 
"yes,' said alice doubtfully: "it means-to-make-anything-prettier.' 
"well, then,' the gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to 
uglify is, you are a simpleton.' 
alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about 
it, so she turned to the mock turtle, and said "what else had you 
to learn?' 
"well, there was mystery,' the mock turtle replied, counting 
off the subjects on his flappers, "-mystery, ancient and modern, 
with seaography: then drawling-the drawling-master was an old 
conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us 
drawling, stretching, and fainting in coils.' 
"what was that like?' said alice. 
"well, i can't show it you myself,' the mock turtle said: "i'm 
too stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it.' 
"hadn't time,' said the gryphon: "i went to the classics 
master, though. he was an old crab, he was.' 
"i never went to him,' the mock turtle said with a sigh: "he 
taught laughing and grief, they used to say.' 
"so he did, so he did,' said the gryphon, sighing in his turn; 
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 
"and how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said alice, in a 
hurry to change the subject. 
"ten hours the first day,' said the mock turtle: "nine the 
next, and so on.' 
"what a curious plan!' exclaimed alice. 
"that's the reason they're called lessons,' the gryphon 
remarked: "because they lessen from day to day.' 
this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a 
little before she made her next remark. "then the eleventh day 
must have been a holiday?' 
"of course it was,' said the mock turtle. 
"and how did you manage on the twelfth?' alice went on eagerly. 
"that's enough about lessons,' the gryphon interrupted in a 
very decided tone: "tell her something about the games now.' 
chapter x 
the lobster quadrille 
the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper 
across his eyes. he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for 
a minute or two sobs choked his voice. "same as if he had a bone 
in his throat,' said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him 
and punching him in the back. at last the mock turtle recovered 
his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on 
again:- 
"you may not have lived much under the sea-' ("i haven't,' said alice)- 
"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster-' 
(alice began to say "i once tasted-' but checked herself hastily, 
and said "no, never') "-so you can have no idea what a delightful 
thing a lobster quadrille is!' 
"no, indeed,' said alice. "what sort of a dance is it?' 
"why,' said the gryphon, "you first form into a line along the sea-shore-' 
"two lines!' cried the mock turtle. "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; 
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way-' 
"that generally takes some time,' interrupted the gryphon. 
"-you advance twice-' 
"each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the gryphon. 
"of course,' the mock turtle said: "advance twice, set to 
partners-' 
"-change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the 
gryphon. 
"then, you know,' the mock turtle went on, "you throw the-' 
"the lobsters!' shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air. 
"-as far out to sea as you can-' 
"swim after them!' screamed the gryphon. 
"turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the mock turtle, 
capering wildly about. 
"change lobster's again!' yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice. 
"back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the 
mock turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, 
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat 
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at alice. 
"it must be a very pretty dance,' said alice timidly. 
"would you like to see a little of it?' said the mock turtle. 
"very much indeed,' said alice. 
"come, let's try the first figure!' said the mock turtle to the 
gryphon. "we can do without lobsters, you know. which shall 
sing?' 
"oh, you sing,' said the gryphon. "i've forgotten the words.' 
so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now 
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and 
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle 
sang this, very slowly and sadly:- 
""will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. 
"there's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my 
tail. 
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! 
they are waiting on the shingle-will you come and join the 
dance? 
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the 
dance? 
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the 
dance? 
"you can really have no notion how delightful it will be 
when they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to 
sea!" 
but the snail replied "too far, too far!" and gave a look 
askance- 
said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the 
dance. 
would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join 
the dance. 
would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join 
the dance. 
""what matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. 
"there is another shore, you know, upon the other side. 
the further off from england the nearer is to france- 
then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. 
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the 
dance? 
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the 
dance?"' 
"thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said 
alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: "and i do so 
like that curious song about the whiting!' 
"oh, as to the whiting,' said the mock turtle, "they-you've 
seen them, of course?' 
"yes,' said alice, "i've often seen them at dinn-' she 
checked herself hastily. 
"i don't know where dinn may be,' said the mock turtle, "but 
if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're 
like.' 
"i believe so,' alice replied thoughtfully. "they have their 
tails in their mouths-and they're all over crumbs.' 
"you're wrong about the crumbs,' said the mock turtle: 
"crumbs would all wash off in the sea. but they have their tails 
in their mouths; and the reason is-' here the mock turtle 
yawned and shut his eyes.-"tell her about the reason and all 
that,' he said to the gryphon. 
"the reason is,' said the gryphon, "that they would go with 
the lobsters to the dance. so they got thrown out to sea. so 
they had to fall a long way. so they got their tails fast in 
their mouths. so they couldn't get them out again. that's all.' 
"thank you,' said alice, "it's very interesting. i never knew 
so much about a whiting before.' 
"i can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the 
gryphon. "do you know why it's called a whiting?' 
"i never thought about it,' said alice. "why?' 
"it does the boots and shoes.' the gryphon replied very 
solemnly. 
alice was thoroughly puzzled. "does the boots and shoes!' she 
repeated in a wondering tone. 
"why, what are your shoes done with?' said the gryphon. "i 
mean, what makes them so shiny?' 
alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she 
gave her answer. "they're done with blacking, i believe.' 
"boots and shoes under the sea,' the gryphon went on in a deep 
voice, "are done with a whiting. now you know.' 
"and what are they made of?' alice asked in a tone of great 
curiosity. 
"soles and eels, of course,' the gryphon replied rather 
impatiently: "any shrimp could have told you that.' 
"if i'd been the whiting,' said alice, whose thoughts were 
still running on the song, "i'd have said to the porpoise, "keep 
back, please: we don't want you with us!"' 
"they were obliged to have him with them,' the mock turtle 
said: "no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' 
"wouldn't it really?' said alice in a tone of great surprise. 
"of course not,' said the mock turtle: "why, if a fish came 
to me, and told me he was going a journey, i should say "with 
what porpoise?"' 
"don't you mean "purpose"?' said alice. 
"i mean what i say,' the mock turtle replied in an offended 
tone. and the gryphon added "come, let's hear some of your 
adventures.' 
"i could tell you my adventures-beginning from this morning,' 
said alice a little timidly: "but it's no use going back to 
yesterday, because i was a different person then.' 
"explain all that,' said the mock turtle. 
"no, no! the adventures first,' said the gryphon in an 
impatient tone: "explanations take such a dreadful time.' 
so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when 
she first saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about 
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on 
each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she 
gained courage as she went on. her listeners were perfectly 
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating "you are old, 
father william,' to the caterpillar, and the words all coming 
different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath, and said 
"that's very curious.' 
"it's all about as curious as it can be,' said the gryphon. 
"it all came different!' the mock turtle repeated 
thoughtfully. "i should like to hear her try and repeat 
something now. tell her to begin.' he looked at the gryphon as 
if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice. 
"stand up and repeat "'tis the voice of the sluggard,"' said 
the gryphon. 
"how the creatures order one about, and make one repeat 
lessons!' thought alice; "i might as well be at school at once.' 
however, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so 
full of the lobster quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was 
saying, and the words came very queer indeed:- 
"'tis the voice of the lobster; i heard him declare, 
"you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair." 
as a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose 
trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.' 
[later editions continued as follows 
when the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, 
and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark, 
but, when the tide rises and sharks are around, 
his voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] 
"that's different from what i used to say when i was a child,' 
said the gryphon. 
"well, i never heard it before,' said the mock turtle; "but it 
sounds uncommon nonsense.' 
alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her 
hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way 
again. 
"i should like to have it explained,' said the mock turtle. 
"she can't explain it,' said the gryphon hastily. "go on with 
the next verse.' 
"but about his toes?' the mock turtle persisted. "how could 
he turn them out with his nose, you know?' 
"it's the first position in dancing.' alice said; but was 
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the 
subject. 
"go on with the next verse,' the gryphon repeated impatiently: 
"it begins "i passed by his garden."' 
alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would 
all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:- 
"i passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, 
how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie-' 
[later editions continued as follows 
the panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, 
while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat. 
when the pie was all finished, the owl, as a boon, 
was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: 
while the panther received knife and fork with a growl, 
and concluded the banquet-] 
"what is the use of repeating all that stuff,' the mock turtle 
interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on? it's by far 
the most confusing thing i ever heard!' 
"yes, i think you'd better leave off,' said the gryphon: and 
alice was only too glad to do so. 
"shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille?' the 
gryphon went on. "or would you like the mock turtle to sing you 
a song?' 
"oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind,' 
alice replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a rather 
offended tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! sing her 
"turtle soup," will you, old fellow?' 
the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes 
choked with sobs, to sing this:- 
"beautiful soup, so rich and green, 
waiting in a hot tureen! 
who for such dainties would not stoop? 
soup of the evening, beautiful soup! 
soup of the evening, beautiful soup! 
beau-ootiful soo-oop! 
beau-ootiful soo-oop! 
soo-oop of the e-e-evening, 
beautiful, beautiful soup! 
"beautiful soup! who cares for fish, 
game, or any other dish? 
who would not give all else for two p 
ennyworth only of beautiful soup? 
pennyworth only of beautiful soup? 
beau-ootiful soo-oop! 
beau-ootiful soo-oop! 
soo-oop of the e-e-evening, 
beautiful, beauti-ful soup!' 
"chorus again!' cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had 
just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's beginning!' 
was heard in the distance. 
"come on!' cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, 
it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. 
"what trial is it?' alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon 
only answered "come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more 
faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the 
melancholy words:- 
"soo-oop of the e-e-evening, 
beautiful, beautiful soup!' 
chapter xi 
who stole the tarts? 
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when 
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them-all sorts 
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: 
the knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on 
each side to guard him; and near the king was the white rabbit, 
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the 
other. in the very middle of the court was a table, with a large 
dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made alice 
quite hungry to look at them-"i wish they'd get the trial done,' 
she thought, "and hand round the refreshments!' but there seemed 
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about 
her, to pass away the time. 
alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had 
read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that 
she knew the name of nearly everything there. "that's the 
judge,' she said to herself, "because of his great wig.' 
the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crown 
over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he 
did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly 
not becoming. 
"and that's the jury-box,' thought alice, "and those twelve 
creatures,' (she was obliged to say "creatures,' you see, because 
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) "i suppose they 
are the jurors.' she said this last word two or three times over 
to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and 
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the 
meaning of it at all. however, "jury-men' would have done just 
as well. 
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 
"what are they doing?' alice whispered to the gryphon. "they 
can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' 
"they're putting down their names,' the gryphon whispered in 
reply, "for fear they should forget them before the end of the 
trial.' 
"stupid things!' alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but 
she stopped hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, "silence in 
the court!' and the king put on his spectacles and looked 
anxiously round, to make out who was talking. 
alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their 
shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down "stupid things!' 
on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them 
didn't know how to spell "stupid,' and that he had to ask his 
neighbour to tell him. "a nice muddle their slates'll be in 
before the trial's over!' thought alice. 
one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course, 
alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got 
behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it 
away. she did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was 
bill, the lizard) could not make out at all what had become of 
it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write 
with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very 
little use, as it left no mark on the slate. 
"herald, read the accusation!' said the king. 
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and 
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:- 
"the queen of hearts, she made some tarts, 
all on a summer day: 
the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts, 
and took them quite away!' 
"consider your verdict,' the king said to the jury. 
"not yet, not yet!' the rabbit hastily interrupted. "there's 
a great deal to come before that!' 
"call the first witness,' said the king; and the white rabbit 
blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, "first 
witness!' 
the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in 
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "i beg 
pardon, your majesty,' he began, "for bringing these in: but i 
hadn't quite finished my tea when i was sent for.' 
"you ought to have finished,' said the king. "when did you 
begin?' 
the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into 
the court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse. "fourteenth of march, i 
think it was,' he said. 
"fifteenth,' said the march hare. 
"sixteenth,' added the dormouse. 
"write that down,' the king said to the jury, and the jury 
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then 
added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. 
"take off your hat,' the king said to the hatter. 
"it isn't mine,' said the hatter. 
"stolen!' the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, who 
instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 
"i keep them to sell,' the hatter added as an explanation; 
"i've none of my own. i'm a hatter.' 
here the queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the 
hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 
"give your evidence,' said the king; "and don't be nervous, or 
i'll have you executed on the spot.' 
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept 
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the 
queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his 
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. 
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which 
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was 
beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she 
would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she 
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for 
her. 
"i wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the dormouse, who was 
sitting next to her. "i can hardly breathe.' 
"i can't help it,' said alice very meekly: "i'm growing.' 
"you've no right to grow here,' said the dormouse. 
"don't talk nonsense,' said alice more boldly: "you know 
you're growing too.' 
"yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,' said the dormouse: 
"not in that ridiculous fashion.' and he got up very sulkily 
and crossed over to the other side of the court. 
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the 
hatter, and, just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to 
one of the officers of the court, "bring me the list of the 
singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched hatter 
trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 
"give your evidence,' the king repeated angrily, "or i'll have 
you executed, whether you're nervous or not.' 
"i'm a poor man, your majesty,' the hatter began, in a 
trembling voice, "-and i hadn't begun my tea-not above a week 
or so-and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin-and 
the twinkling of the tea-' 
"the twinkling of the what?' said the king. 
"it began with the tea,' the hatter replied. 
"of course twinkling begins with a t!' said the king sharply. 
"do you take me for a dunce? go on!' 
"i'm a poor man,' the hatter went on, "and most things 
twinkled after that-only the march hare said-' 
"i didn't!' the march hare interrupted in a great hurry. 
"you did!' said the hatter. 
"i deny it!' said the march hare. 
"he denies it,' said the king: "leave out that part.' 
"well, at any rate, the dormouse said-' the hatter went on, 
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the 
dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. 
"after that,' continued the hatter, "i cut some more bread- 
and-butter-' 
"but what did the dormouse say?' one of the jury asked. 
"that i can't remember,' said the hatter. 
"you must remember,' remarked the king, "or i'll have you 
executed.' 
the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, 
and went down on one knee. "i'm a poor man, your majesty,' he 
began. 
"you're a very poor speaker,' said the king. 
here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately 
suppressed by the officers of the court. (as that is rather a 
hard word, i will just explain to you how it was done. they had 
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: 
into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat 
upon it.) 
"i'm glad i've seen that done,' thought alice. "i've so often 
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "there was some 
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the 
officers of the court," and i never understood what it meant 
till now.' 
"if that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' 
continued the king. 
"i can't go no lower,' said the hatter: "i'm on the floor, as 
it is.' 
"then you may sit down,' the king replied. 
here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. 
"come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought alice. "now we 
shall get on better.' 
"i'd rather finish my tea,' said the hatter, with an anxious 
look at the queen, who was reading the list of singers. 
"you may go,' said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the 
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. 
"-and just take his head off outside,' the queen added to one 
of the officers: but the hatter was out of sight before the 
officer could get to the door. 
"call the next witness!' said the king. 
the next witness was the duchess's cook. she carried the 
pepper-box in her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even before 
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began 
sneezing all at once. 
"give your evidence,' said the king. 
"shan't,' said the cook. 
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a 
low voice, "your majesty must cross-examine this witness.' 
"well, if i must, i must,' the king said, with a melancholy 
air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till 
his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, "what 
are tarts made of?' 
"pepper, mostly,' said the cook. 
"treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her. 
"collar that dormouse,' the queen shrieked out. "behead that 
dormouse! turn that dormouse out of court! suppress him! pinch 
him! off with his whiskers!' 
for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the 
dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down 
again, the cook had disappeared. 
"never mind!' said the king, with an air of great relief. 
"call the next witness.' and he added in an undertone to the 
queen, "really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. 
it quite makes my forehead ache!' 
alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list, 
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, 
"-for they haven't got much evidence yet,' she said to herself. 
imagine her surprise, when the white rabbit read out, at the top 
of his shrill little voice, the name "alice!' 
chapter xii 
alice's evidence 
"here!' cried alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the 
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she 
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with 
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads 
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding 
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset 
the week before. 
"oh, i beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great 
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, 
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and 
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once 
and put back into the jury-box, or they would die. 
"the trial cannot proceed,' said the king in a very grave 
voice, "until all the jurymen are back in their proper places- 
all,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at alice as 
he said do. 
alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she 
had put the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing 
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable 
to move. she soon got it out again, and put it right; "not that 
it signifies much,' she said to herself; "i should think it 
would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' 
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of 
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and 
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write 
out a history of the accident, all except the lizard, who seemed 
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, 
gazing up into the roof of the court. 
"what do you know about this business?' the king said to 
alice. 
"nothing,' said alice. 
"nothing whatever?' persisted the king. 
"nothing whatever,' said alice. 
"that's very important,' the king said, turning to the jury. 
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when 
the white rabbit interrupted: "unimportant, your majesty means, 
of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and 
making faces at him as he spoke. 
"unimportant, of course, i meant,' the king hastily said, and 
went on to himself in an undertone, "important-unimportant- 
unimportant-important-' as if he were trying which word 
sounded best. 
some of the jury wrote it down "important,' and some 
"unimportant.' alice could see this, as she was near enough to 
look over their slates; "but it doesn't matter a bit,' she 
thought to herself. 
at this moment the king, who had been for some time busily 
writing in his note-book, cackled out "silence!' and read out 
from his book, "rule forty-two. all persons more than a mile 
high to leave the court.' 
everybody looked at alice. 
"i'm not a mile high,' said alice. 
"you are,' said the king. 
"nearly two miles high,' added the queen. 
"well, i shan't go, at any rate,' said alice: "besides, 
that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.' 
"it's the oldest rule in the book,' said the king. 
"then it ought to be number one,' said alice. 
the king turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 
"consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling 
voice. 
"there's more evidence to come yet, please your majesty,' said 
the white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; "this paper has 
just been picked up.' 
"what's in it?' said the queen. 
"i haven't opened it yet,' said the white rabbit, "but it seems 
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to-to somebody.' 
"it must have been that,' said the king, "unless it was 
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' 
"who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen. 
"it isn't directed at all,' said the white rabbit; "in fact, 
there's nothing written on the outside.' he unfolded the paper 
as he spoke, and added "it isn't a letter, after all: it's a set 
of verses.' 
"are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of 
they jurymen. 
"no, they're not,' said the white rabbit, "and that's the 
queerest thing about it.' (the jury all looked puzzled.) 
"he must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the king. 
(the jury all brightened up again.) 
"please your majesty,' said the knave, "i didn't write it, and 
they can't prove i did: there's no name signed at the end.' 
"if you didn't sign it,' said the king, "that only makes the 
matter worse. you must have meant some mischief, or else you'd 
have signed your name like an honest man.' 
there was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the 
first really clever thing the king had said that day. 
"that proves his guilt,' said the queen. 
"it proves nothing of the sort!' said alice. "why, you don't 
even know what they're about!' 
"read them,' said the king. 
the white rabbit put on his spectacles. "where shall i begin, 
please your majesty?' he asked. 
"begin at the beginning,' the king said gravely, "and go on 
till you come to the end: then stop.' 
these were the verses the white rabbit read:- 
"they told me you had been to her, 
and mentioned me to him: 
she gave me a good character, 
but said i could not swim. 
he sent them word i had not gone 
(we know it to be true): 
if she should push the matter on, 
what would become of you? 
i gave her one, they gave him two, 
you gave us three or more; 
they all returned from him to you, 
though they were mine before. 
if i or she should chance to be 
involved in this affair, 
he trusts to you to set them free, 
exactly as we were. 
my notion was that you had been 
(before she had this fit) 
an obstacle that came between 
him, and ourselves, and it. 
don't let him know she liked them best, 
for this must ever be 
a secret, kept from all the rest, 
between yourself and me.' 
"that's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' 
said the king, rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury-' 
"if any one of them can explain it,' said alice, (she had 
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit 
afraid of interrupting him,) "i'll give him sixpence. _i_ don't 
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' 
the jury all wrote down on their slates, "she doesn't believe 
there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to 
explain the paper. 
"if there's no meaning in it,' said the king, "that saves a 
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. and 
yet i don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his 
knee, and looking at them with one eye; "i seem to see some 
meaning in them, after all. "-said i could not swim-" you 
can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the knave. 
the knave shook his head sadly. "do i look like it?' he said. 
(which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.) 
"all right, so far,' said the king, and he went on muttering 
over the verses to himself: ""we know it to be true-" that's 
the jury, of course- "i gave her one, they gave him two-" why, 
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know-' 
"but, it goes on "they all returned from him to you,"' said 
alice. 
"why, there they are!' said the king triumphantly, pointing to 
the tarts on the table. "nothing can be clearer than that. 
then again-"before she had this fit-" you never had fits, my 
dear, i think?' he said to the queen. 
"never!' said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the 
lizard as she spoke. (the unfortunate little bill had left off 
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no 
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was 
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) 
"then the words don't fit you,' said the king, looking round 
the court with a smile. there was a dead silence. 
"it's a pun!' the king added in an offended tone, and 
everybody laughed, "let the jury consider their verdict,' the 
king said, for about the twentieth time that day. 
"no, no!' said the queen. "sentence first-verdict afterwards.' 
"stuff and nonsense!' said alice loudly. "the idea of having 
the sentence first!' 
"hold your tongue!' said the queen, turning purple. 
"i won't!' said alice. 
"off with her head!' the queen shouted at the top of her voice. 
nobody moved. 
"who cares for you?' said alice, (she had grown to her full 
size by this time.) "you're nothing but a pack of cards!' 
at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying 
down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half 
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on 
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently 
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the 
trees upon her face. 
"wake up, alice dear!' said her sister; "why, what a long 
sleep you've had!' 
"oh, i've had such a curious dream!' said alice, and she told 
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange 
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and 
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, "it was a 
curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's 
getting late.' so alice got up and ran off, thinking while she 
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. 
but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her 
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of 
little alice and all her wonderful adventures, till she too began 
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:- 
first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the 
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes 
were looking up into hers-she could hear the very tones of her 
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back 
the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes-and 
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place 
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little 
sister's dream. 
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried 
by-the frightened mouse splashed his way through the 
neighbouring pool-she could hear the rattle of the teacups as 
the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, 
and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate 
guests to execution-once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the 
duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it-once 
more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizard's 
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, 
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable 
mock turtle. 
so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in 
wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and 
all would change to dull reality-the grass would be only 
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the 
reeds-the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- 
bells, and the queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd 
boy-and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the gryphon, and 
all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the 
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard-while the lowing of the 
cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle's 
heavy sobs. 
lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of 
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how 
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and 
loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about 
her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager 
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of 
wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their 
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, 
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take 
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright 
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. this

the picture of dorian gray 
by

the preface 
the artist is the creator of beautiful things. to reveal art and conceal 
the artist is art's aim. the critic is he who can translate into another 
manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things. 
the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. 
those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without 
being charming. this is a fault. 
those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. 
for these there is hope. they are the elect to whom beautiful things 
mean only beauty. 
there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. 
books are well written, or badly written. that is all. 
the nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of caliban 
seeing his own face in a glass. 
the nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of 
caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. the moral life of man 
forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality 
of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. 
no artist desires to prove anything. even things that are true 
can be proved. no artist has ethical sympathies. an ethical 
sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. 
no artist is ever morbid. the artist can express everything. 
thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. 
vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. 
from the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art 
of the musician. from the point of view of feeling, the actor's 
craft is the type. all art is at once surface and symbol. 
those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. 
those who read the symbol do so at their peril. 
it is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. 
diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work 
is new, complex, and vital. when critics disagree, 
the artist is in accord with himself. we can forgive a man 
for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. 
the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one 
admires it intensely. 
all art is quite useless. 
oscar wilde 
chapter 1 
the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when 
the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, 
there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, 
or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn. 
from the corner of the divan of persian saddle-bags on which 
he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, 
lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and 
honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed 
hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; 
and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted 
across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front 
of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary japanese effect, 
and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of tokyo who, 
through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, 
seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. the sullen murmur 
of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, 
or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of 
the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. 
the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ. 
in the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length 
portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, 
some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, basil hallward, 
whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public 
excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures. 
as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully 
mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed 
about to linger there. but he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, 
placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his 
brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake. 
"it is your best work, basil, the best thing you have ever done," 
said lord henry languidly. "you must certainly send it next year 
to the grosvenor. the academy is too large and too vulgar. 
whenever i have gone there, there have been either so many people that i 
have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many 
pictures that i have not been able to see the people, which was worse. 
the grosvenor is really the only place." 
"i don't think i shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head 
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at oxford. 
"no, i won't send it anywhere." 
lord henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through 
the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls 
from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. "not send it anywhere? 
my dear fellow, why? have you any reason? what odd chaps you 
painters are! you do anything in the world to gain a reputation. 
as soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. 
it is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse 
than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. 
a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england, 
and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of 
any emotion." 
"i know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but i really can't exhibit it. 
i have put too much of myself into it." 
lord henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. 
"yes, i knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same." 
"too much of yourself in it! upon my word, basil, 
i didn't know you were so vain; and i really can't see any resemblance 
between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, 
and this young adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory 
and rose-leaves. why, my dear basil, he is a narcissus, and you- 
well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. 
but beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. 
intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys 
the harmony of any face. the moment one sits down to think, 
one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. 
look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. 
how perfectly hideous they are! except, of course, in the church. 
but then in the church they don't think. a bishop keeps on saying at 
the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, 
and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. 
your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, 
but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. i feel quite 
sure of that. he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be 
always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always 
here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. 
don't flatter yourself, basil: you are not in the least like 
him." 
"you don't understand me, harry," answered the artist. "of course i am 
not like him. i know that perfectly well. indeed, i should be sorry 
to look like him. you shrug your shoulders? i am telling you the truth. 
there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, 
the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering 
steps of kings. it is better not to be different from one's fellows. 
the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. they can sit 
at their ease and gape at the play. if they know nothing of victory, 
they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. they live as we 
all should live-undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. 
they neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. 
your rank and wealth, harry; my brains, such as they are-my art, whatever it 
may be worth; dorian gray's good looks-we shall all suffer for what the gods 
have given us, suffer terribly." 
"dorian gray? is that his name?" asked lord henry, walking across 
the studio towards basil hallward. 
"yes, that is his name. i didn't intend to tell it to you." 
"but why not?" 
"oh, i can't explain. when i like people immensely, i never tell 
their names to any one. it is like surrendering a part of them. 
i have grown to love secrecy. it seems to be the one thing 
that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. 
the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. 
when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going. 
if i did, i would lose all my pleasure. it is a silly habit, 
i dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance 
into one's life. i suppose you think me awfully foolish 
about it?" 
"not at all," answered lord henry, "not at all, my dear basil. 
you seem to forget that i am married, and the one charm of marriage is 
that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. 
i never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what i am doing. 
when we meet-we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go 
down to the duke's-we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most 
serious faces. my wife is very good at it-much better, in fact, than i am. 
she never gets confused over her dates, and i always do. but when she 
does find me out, she makes no row at all. i sometimes wish she would; 
but she merely laughs at me." 
"i hate the way you talk about your married life, harry," 
said basil hallward, strolling towards the door that led into 
the garden. "i believe that you are really a very good husband, 
but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. 
you are an extraordinary fellow. you never say a moral thing, 
and you never do a wrong thing. your cynicism is simply 
a pose." 
"being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose i know," 
cried lord henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden 
together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the 
shade of a tall laurel bush. the sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. 
in the grass, white daisies were tremulous. 
after a pause, lord henry pulled out his watch. "i am afraid i 
must be going, basil," he murmured, "and before i go, i insist 
on your answering a question i put to you some time ago." 
"what is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground. 
"you know quite well." 
"i do not, harry." 
"well, i will tell you what it is. i want you to explain to me why you 
won't exhibit dorian gray's picture. i want the real reason." 
"i told you the real reason." 
"no, you did not. you said it was because there was too much 
of yourself in it. now, that is childish." 
"harry," said basil hallward, looking him straight in the face, 
"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, 
not of the sitter. the sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. 
it is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, 
on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. the reason i will not exhibit 
this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my 
own soul." 
lord henry laughed. "and what is that?" he asked. 
"i will tell you," said hallward; but an expression of perplexity 
came over his face. 
"i am all expectation, basil," continued his companion, 
glancing at him. 
"oh, there is really very little to tell, harry," answered the painter; 
"and i am afraid you will hardly understand it. perhaps you will hardly 
believe it." 
lord henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from 
the grass and examined it. "i am quite sure i shall understand it," 
he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, 
"and as for believing things, i can believe anything, provided that it is 
quite incredible." 
the wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, 
with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. 
a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread 
a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings. 
lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward's heart beating, 
and wondered what was coming. 
"the story is simply this," said the painter after some time. 
"two months ago i went to a crush at lady brandon's. you know 
we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time 
to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages. 
with an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, 
even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized. 
well, after i had been in the room about ten minutes, 
talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, 
i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. 
i turned half-way round and saw dorian gray for the first time. 
when our eyes met, i felt that i was growing pale. 
a curious sensation of terror came over me. i knew that i 
had come face to face with some one whose mere personality 
was so fascinating that, if i allowed it to do so, it would 
absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. 
i did not want any external influence in my life. 
you know yourself, harry, how independent i am by nature. 
i have always been my own master; had at least always been so, 
till i met dorian gray. then-but i don't know how to explain 
it to you. something seemed to tell me that i was on the verge 
of a terrible crisis in my life. i had a strange feeling that 
fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. 
i grew afraid and turned to quit the room. it was not conscience 
that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. i take no 
credit to myself for trying to escape." 
"conscience and cowardice are really the same things, basil. 
conscience is the trade-name of the firm. that is all." 
"i don't believe that, harry, and i don't believe you do either. 
however, whatever was my motive-and it may have been pride, 
for i used to be very proud-i certainly struggled to the door. 
there, of course, i stumbled against lady brandon. 'you are not 
going to run away so soon, mr. hallward?' she screamed out. 
you know her curiously shrill voice?" 
"yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said lord henry, 
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers. 
"i could not get rid of her. she brought me up to royalties, 
and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic 
tiaras and parrot noses. she spoke of me as her dearest friend. 
i had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. 
i believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, 
at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is 
the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. suddenly i found myself 
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely 
stirred me. we were quite close, almost touching. our eyes met again. 
it was reckless of me, but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him. 
perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. it was simply inevitable. 
we would have spoken to each other without any introduction. 
i am sure of that. dorian told me so afterwards. he, too, felt that we 
were destined to know each other." 
"and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man?" 
asked his companion. "i know she goes in for giving 
a rapid precis of all her guests. i remember her bringing 
me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered 
all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, 
in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible 
to everybody in the room, the most astounding details. 
i simply fled. i like to find out people for myself. 
but lady brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer 
treats his goods. she either explains them entirely away, 
or tells one everything about them except what one wants 
to know." 
"poor lady brandon! you are hard on her, harry!" said hallward listlessly. 
"my dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and only succeeded 
in opening a restaurant. how could i admire her? but tell me, 
what did she say about mr. dorian gray?" 
"oh, something like, 'charming boy-poor dear mother and i 
absolutely inseparable. quite forget what he does-afraid he- 
doesn't do anything-oh, yes, plays the piano-or is it 
the violin, dear mr. gray?' neither of us could help laughing, 
and we became friends at once." 
"laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, 
and it is far the best ending for one," said the young lord, 
plucking another daisy. 
hallward shook his head. "you don't understand what friendship is, harry," 
he murmured-"or what enmity is, for that matter. you like every one; 
that is to say, you are indifferent to every one." 
"how horribly unjust of you!" cried lord henry, tilting his hat back 
and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy 
white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky. 
"yes; horribly unjust of you. i make a great difference between people. 
i choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for 
their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. 
a man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. i have not 
got one who is a fool. they are all men of some intellectual power, 
and consequently they all appreciate me. is that very vain of me? 
i think it is rather vain." 
"i should think it was, harry. but according to your category i 
must be merely an acquaintance." 
"my dear old basil, you are much more than an acquaintance." 
"and much less than a friend. a sort of brother, i suppose?" 
"oh, brothers! i don't care for brothers. my elder brother won't die, 
and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else." 
"harry!" exclaimed hallward, frowning. 
"my dear fellow, i am not quite serious. but i can't help detesting 
my relations. i suppose it comes from the fact that none of us 
can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. 
i quite sympathize with the rage of the english democracy against 
what they call the vices of the upper orders. the masses feel 
that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own 
special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, 
he is poaching on their preserves. when poor southwark got 
into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent. 
and yet i don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat 
live correctly." 
"i don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, 
harry, i feel sure you don't either." 
lord henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe 
of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. 
"how english you are basil! that is the second time you 
have made that observation. if one puts forward an idea 
to a true englishman-always a rash thing to do-he never 
dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. 
the only thing he considers of any importance is whether one 
believes it oneself. now, the value of an idea has nothing 
whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. 
indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere 
the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, 
as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, 
his desires, or his prejudices. however, i don't propose 
to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. 
i like persons better than principles, and i like persons 
with no principles better than anything else in the world. 
tell me more about mr. dorian gray. how often do you 
see him?" 
"every day. i couldn't be happy if i didn't see him every day. 
he is absolutely necessary to me." 
"how extraordinary! i thought you would never care for anything 
but your art." 
"he is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely. 
"i sometimes think, harry, that there are only two eras of any 
importance in the world's history. the first is the appearance 
of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance 
of a new personality for art also. what the invention 
of oil-painting was to the venetians, the face of antinous 
was to late greek sculpture, and the face of dorian gray will 
some day be to me. it is not merely that i paint from him, 
draw from him, sketch from him. of course, i have done all that. 
but he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. 
i won't tell you that i am dissatisfied with what i have done 
of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. 
there is nothing that art cannot express, and i know that 
the work i have done, since i met dorian gray, is good work, 
is the best work of my life. but in some curious way-i wonder 
will you understand me?-his personality has suggested to me 
an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. 
i see things differently, i think of them differently. 
i can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. 
'a dream of form in days of thought'-who is it who says that? 
i forget; but it is what dorian gray has been to me. 
the merely visible presence of this lad-for he seems to me 
little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty- 
his merely visible presence-ah! i wonder can you realize 
all that that means? unconsciously he defines for me 
the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it 
all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection 
of the spirit that is greek. the harmony of soul and body- 
how much that is! we in our madness have separated the two, 
and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that 
is void. harry! if you only knew what dorian gray is to me! 
you remember that landscape of mine, for which agnew offered 
me such a huge price but which i would not part with? 
it is one of the best things i have ever done. and why 
is it so? because, while i was painting it, dorian gray sat 
beside me. some subtle influence passed from him to me, 
and for the first time in my life i saw in the plain 
woodland the wonder i had always looked for and always 
missed." 
"basil, this is extraordinary! i must see dorian gray." 
hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. 
after some time he came back. "harry," he said, "dorian gray 
is to me simply a motive in art. you might see nothing in him. 
i see everything in him. he is never more present in my work than 
when no image of him is there. he is a suggestion, as i have said, 
of a new manner. i find him in the curves of certain lines, 
in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. 
that is all." 
"then why won't you exhibit his portrait?" asked lord henry. 
"because, without intending it, i have put into it some expression 
of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, 
i have never cared to speak to him. he knows nothing about it. 
he shall never know anything about it. but the world might guess it, 
and i will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. 
my heart shall never be put under their microscope. there is too much 
of myself in the thing, harry-too much of myself!" 
"poets are not so scrupulous as you are. they know how useful passion 
is for publication. nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions." 
"i hate them for it," cried hallward. "an artist should create 
beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. 
we live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form 
of autobiography. we have lost the abstract sense of beauty. 
some day i will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world 
shall never see my portrait of dorian gray." 
"i think you are wrong, basil, but i won't argue with you. 
it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. tell me, 
is dorian gray very fond of you?" 
the painter considered for a few moments. "he likes me," 
he answered after a pause; "i know he likes me. of course i 
flatter him dreadfully. i find a strange pleasure in saying 
things to him that i know i shall be sorry for having said. 
as a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk 
of a thousand things. now and then, however, he is horribly 
thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. 
then i feel, harry, that i have given away my whole soul to some 
one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, 
a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a 
summer's day." 
"days in summer, basil, are apt to linger," murmured lord henry. 
"perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. it is a sad thing to think of, 
but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. that accounts 
for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. 
in the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, 
and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping 
our place. the thoroughly well-informed man-that is the modern ideal. 
and the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. 
it is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything 
priced above its proper value. i think you will tire first, all the same. 
some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little 
out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something. you will 
bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has 
behaved very badly to you. the next time he calls, you will be perfectly 
cold and indifferent. it will be a great pity, for it will alter you. 
what you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, 
and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one 
so unromantic." 
"harry, don't talk like that. as long as i live, the personality 
of dorian gray will dominate me. you can't feel what i feel. 
you change too often." 
"ah, my dear basil, that is exactly why i can feel it. 
those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: 
it is the faithless who know love's tragedies." and lord 
henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began 
to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, 
as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. there was 
a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves 
of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across 
the grass like swallows. how pleasant it was in the garden! 
and how delightful other people's emotions were!- 
much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. 
one's own soul, and the passions of one's friends-those were 
the fascinating things in life. he pictured to himself 
with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed 
by staying so long with basil hallward. had he gone to his 
aunt's, he would have been sure to have met lord goodbody there, 
and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding 
of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. each 
class would have preached the importance of those virtues, 
for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. 
the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, 
and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. 
it was charming to have escaped all that! as he thought of his aunt, 
an idea seemed to strike him. he turned to hallward and said, 
"my dear fellow, i have just remembered." 
"remembered what, harry?" 
"where i heard the name of dorian gray." 
"where was it?" asked hallward, with a slight frown. 
"don't look so angry, basil. it was at my aunt, lady agatha's. 
she told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going 
to help her in the east end, and that his name was dorian gray. 
i am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. women 
have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. 
she said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature. 
i at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, 
horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. i wish i had known it 
was your friend." 
"i am very glad you didn't, harry." 
"why?" 
"i don't want you to meet him." 
"you don't want me to meet him?" 
"no." 
"mr. dorian gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, 
coming into the garden. 
"you must introduce me now," cried lord henry, laughing. 
the painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. 
"ask mr. gray to wait, parker: i shall be in in a few moments." 
the man bowed and went up the walk. 
then he looked at lord henry. "dorian gray is my dearest friend," 
he said. "he has a simple and a beautiful nature. your aunt 
was quite right in what she said of him. don't spoil him. 
don't try to influence him. your influence would be bad. 
the world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. 
don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art 
whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends 
on him. mind, harry, i trust you." he spoke very slowly, 
and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against 
his will. 
"what nonsense you talk!" said lord henry, smiling, and taking hallward 
by the arm, he almost led him into the house. 
chapter 2 
as they entered they saw dorian gray. he was seated at the piano, 
with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of schumann's 
"forest scenes." "you must lend me these, basil," he cried. 
"i want to learn them. they are perfectly charming." 
"that entirely depends on how you sit to-day, dorian." 
"oh, i am tired of sitting, and i don't want a life-sized portrait 
of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool 
in a wilful, petulant manner. when he caught sight of lord henry, 
a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. 
"i beg your pardon, basil, but i didn't know you had any one 
with you." 
"this is lord henry wotton, dorian, an old oxford friend of mine. 
i have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, 
and now you have spoiled everything." 
"you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, mr. gray," 
said lord henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. 
"my aunt has often spoken to me about you. you are one of 
her favourites, and, i am afraid, one of her victims also." 
"i am in lady agatha's black books at present," answered dorian 
with a funny look of penitence. "i promised to go to a club in 
whitechapel with her last tuesday, and i really forgot all about it. 
we were to have played a duet together-three duets, i believe. 
i don't know what she will say to me. i am far too frightened 
to call." 
"oh, i will make your peace with my aunt. she is quite devoted to you. 
and i don't think it really matters about your not being there. the audience 
probably thought it was a duet. when aunt agatha sits down to the piano, 
she makes quite enough noise for two people." 
"that is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me," 
answered dorian, laughing. 
lord henry looked at him. yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, 
with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp 
gold hair. there was something in his face that made one trust him at once. 
all the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's passionate purity. 
one felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world. no wonder basil 
hallward worshipped him. 
"you are too charming to go in for philanthropy, mr. gray-far too charming." 
and lord henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case. 
the painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready. 
he was looking worried, and when he heard lord henry's last remark, he glanced 
at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "harry, i want to finish this 
picture to-day. would you think it awfully rude of me if i asked you to 
go away?" 
lord henry smiled and looked at dorian gray. "am i to go, mr. gray?" 
he asked. 
"oh, please don't, lord henry. i see that basil is in one of his sulky moods, 
and i can't bear him when he sulks. besides, i want you to tell me why i 
should not go in for philanthropy." 
"i don't know that i shall tell you that, mr. gray. it is so 
tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. 
but i certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. 
you don't really mind, basil, do you? you have often told me that you 
liked your sitters to have some one to chat to." 
hallward bit his lip. "if dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. 
dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself." 
lord henry took up his hat and gloves. "you are very pressing, basil, but i 
am afraid i must go. i have promised to meet a man at the orleans. 
good-bye, mr. gray. come and see me some afternoon in curzon street. 
i am nearly always at home at five o'clock. write to me when you are coming. 
i should be sorry to miss you." 
"basil," cried dorian gray, "if lord henry wotton goes, i shall go, too. 
you never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull 
standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. ask him to stay. 
i insist upon it." 
"stay, harry, to oblige dorian, and to oblige me," said hallward, 
gazing intently at his picture. "it is quite true, i never talk 
when i am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully 
tedious for my unfortunate sitters. i beg you to stay." 
"but what about my man at the orleans?" 
the painter laughed. "i don't think there will be any difficulty about that. 
sit down again, harry. and now, dorian, get up on the platform, and don't 
move about too much, or pay any attention to what lord henry says. 
he has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception 
of myself." 
dorian gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young greek martyr, 
and made a little moue of discontent to lord henry, to whom he had rather 
taken a fancy. he was so unlike basil. they made a delightful contrast. 
and he had such a beautiful voice. after a few moments he said to him, 
"have you really a very bad influence, lord henry? as bad as basil says?" 
"there is no such thing as a good influence, mr. gray. 
all influence is immoral-immoral from the scientific point 
of view." 
"why?" 
"because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. 
he does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. 
his virtues are not real to him. his sins, if there are such things 
as sins, are borrowed. he becomes an echo of some one else's music, 
an actor of a part that has not been written for him. the aim of life 
is self-development. to realize one's nature perfectly-that is what 
each of us is here for. people are afraid of themselves, nowadays. 
they have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes 
to one's self. of course, they are charitable. they feed the hungry 
and clothe the beggar. but their own souls starve, and are naked. 
courage has gone out of our race. perhaps we never really had it. 
the terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of god, 
which is the secret of religion-these are the two things that govern us. 
and yet-" 
"just turn your head a little more to the right, dorian, like a good boy," 
said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come 
into the lad's face that he had never seen there before. 
"and yet," continued lord henry, in his low, musical voice, 
and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so 
characteristic of him, and that he had even in his eton days, 
"i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully 
and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to 
every thought, reality to every dream-i believe that the world 
would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all 
the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the hellenic ideal- 
to something finer, richer than the hellenic ideal, it may be. 
but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. 
the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the 
self-denial that mars our lives. we are punished for our refusals. 
every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind 
and poisons us. the body sins once, and has done with its sin, 
for action is a mode of purification. nothing remains then 
but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. 
the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. 
resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things 
it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous 
laws have made monstrous and unlawful. it has been said 
that the great events of the world take place in the brain. 
it is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins 
of the world take place also. you, mr. gray, you yourself, 
with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had 
passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you 
with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might 
stain your cheek with shame-" 
"stop!" faltered dorian gray, "stop! you bewilder me. 
i don't know what to say. there is some answer to you, but i 
cannot find it. don't speak. let me think. or, rather, let me 
try not to think." 
for nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted 
lips and eyes strangely bright. he was dimly conscious 
that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. 
yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. 
the few words that basil's friend had said to him-words spoken 
by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them- 
had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, 
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to 
curious pulses. 
music had stirred him like that. music had troubled him many times. 
but music was not articulate. it was not a new world, but rather 
another chaos, that it created in us. words! mere words! 
how terrible they were! how clear, and vivid, and cruel! one could 
not escape from them. and yet what a subtle magic there was in them! 
they seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, 
and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. 
mere words! was there anything so real as words? 
yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. 
he understood them now. life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. 
it seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. why had he not 
known it? 
with his subtle smile, lord henry watched him. he knew the precise 
psychological moment when to say nothing. he felt intensely interested. 
he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced, 
and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, 
a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, 
he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience. 
he had merely shot an arrow into the air. had it hit the mark? 
how fascinating the lad was! 
hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, 
that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, 
at any rate comes only from strength. he was unconscious of 
the silence. 
"basil, i am tired of standing," cried dorian gray suddenly. 
"i must go out and sit in the garden. the air is stifling here." 
"my dear fellow, i am so sorry. when i am painting, 
i can't think of anything else. but you never sat better. 
you were perfectly still. and i have caught the effect i wanted- 
the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes. 
i don't know what harry has been saying to you, but he has 
certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. 
i suppose he has been paying you compliments. you mustn't believe 
a word that he says." 
"he has certainly not been paying me compliments. perhaps that is the reason 
that i don't believe anything he has told me." 
"you know you believe it all," said lord henry, looking at him with 
his dreamy languorous eyes. "i will go out to the garden with you. 
it is horribly hot in the studio. basil, let us have something iced 
to drink, something with strawberries in it." 
"certainly, harry. just touch the bell, and when parker comes i 
will tell him what you want. i have got to work up this background, 
so i will join you later on. don't keep dorian too long. 
i have never been in better form for painting than i am to-day. this 
is going to be my masterpiece. it is my masterpiece as it stands." 
lord henry went out to the garden and found dorian gray burying his face in 
the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it 
had been wine. he came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder. 
"you are quite right to do that," he murmured. "nothing can cure the soul 
but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul." 
the lad started and drew back. he was bareheaded, and the leaves 
had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. 
there was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they 
are suddenly awakened. his finely chiselled nostrils quivered, 
and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left 
them trembling. 
"yes," continued lord henry, "that is one of the great secrets of life- 
to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. 
you are a wonderful creation. you know more than you think you know, just as 
you know less than you want to know." 
dorian gray frowned and turned his head away. he could not help 
liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. 
his romantic, olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. 
there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. 
his cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. 
they moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language 
of their own. but he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. 
why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? 
he had known basil hallward for months, but the friendship between them 
had never altered him. suddenly there had come some one across his life 
who seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery. and, yet, what was 
there to be afraid of? he was not a schoolboy or a girl. it was absurd to 
be frightened. 
"let us go and sit in the shade," said lord henry. "parker has 
brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, 
you will be quite spoiled, and basil will never paint you again. 
you really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. it would 
be unbecoming." 
"what can it matter?" cried dorian gray, laughing, as he sat 
down on the seat at the end of the garden. 
"it should matter everything to you, mr. gray." 
"why?" 
"because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing 
worth having." 
"i don't feel that, lord henry." 
"no, you don't feel it now. some day, when you are old 
and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead 
with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its 
hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. 
now, wherever you go, you charm the world. will it always 
be so? . . . you have a wonderfully beautiful face, mr. gray. 
don't frown. you have. and beauty is a form of genius- 
is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. 
it is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, 
or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver 
shell we call the moon. it cannot be questioned. it has its divine 
right of sovereignty. it makes princes of those who have it. 
you smile? ah! when you have lost it you won't smile. 
. . . people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. 
that may be so, but at least it is not so superficial 
as thought is. to me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. 
it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. 
the true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. 
. . . yes, mr. gray, the gods have been good to you. 
but what the gods give they quickly take away. you have only 
a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. 
when your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you 
will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, 
or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that 
the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. 
every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. 
time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. 
you will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. 
you will suffer horribly.... ah! realize your youth 
while you have it. don't squander the gold of your days, 
listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, 
or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, 
and the vulgar. these are the sickly aims, the false ideals, 
of our age. live! live the wonderful life that is in you! 
let nothing be lost upon you. be always searching for 
new sensations. be afraid of nothing. . . . a new hedonism- 
that is what our century wants. you might be its visible symbol. 
with your personality there is nothing you could not do. 
the world belongs to you for a season. . . . the moment i met 
you i saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, 
of what you really might be. there was so much in you that 
charmed me that i felt i must tell you something about yourself. 
i thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. for there is 
such a little time that your youth will last-such a little time. 
the common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. 
the laburnum will be as yellow next june as it is now. 
in a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year 
after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. 
but we never get back our youth. the pulse of joy that beats in us 
at twenty becomes sluggish. our limbs fail, our senses rot. 
we degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory 
of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the 
exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. 
youth! youth! there is absolutely nothing in the world but 
youth!" 
dorian gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. the spray 
of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. a furry bee came 
and buzzed round it for a moment. then it began to scramble 
all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. 
he watched it with that strange interest in trivial things 
that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, 
or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we 
cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies 
us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. 
after a time the bee flew away. he saw it creeping into the stained 
trumpet of a tyrian convolvulus. the flower seemed to quiver, 
and then swayed gently to and fro. 
suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato 
signs for them to come in. they turned to each other and smiled. 
"i am waiting," he cried. "do come in. the light is quite perfect, 
and you can bring your drinks." 
they rose up and sauntered down the walk together. two green-and-white 
butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner 
of the garden a thrush began to sing. 
"you are glad you have met me, mr. gray," said lord henry, 
looking at him. 
"yes, i am glad now. i wonder shall i always be glad?" 
"always! that is a dreadful word. it makes me shudder when i hear it. 
women are so fond of using it. they spoil every romance by trying to make 
it last for ever. it is a meaningless word, too. the only difference 
between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a 
little longer." 
as they entered the studio, dorian gray put his hand upon lord henry's arm. 
"in that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he murmured, flushing at his 
own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose. 
lord henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him. 
the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound 
that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, hallward stepped 
back to look at his work from a distance. in the slanting beams 
that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. 
the heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything. 
after about a quarter of an hour hallward stopped painting, 
looked for a long time at dorian gray, and then for a long 
time at the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes 
and frowning. "it is quite finished," he cried at last, 
and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on 
the left-hand corner of the canvas. 
lord henry came over and examined the picture. it was certainly 
a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well. 
"my dear fellow, i congratulate you most warmly," he said. 
"it is the finest portrait of modern times. mr. gray, come over 
and look at yourself." 
the lad started, as if awakened from some dream. 
"is it really finished?" he murmured, stepping down from the platform. 
"quite finished," said the painter. "and you have sat splendidly 
to-day. i am awfully obliged to you." 
"that is entirely due to me," broke in lord henry. "isn't it, 
mr. gray?" 
dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his 
picture and turned towards it. when he saw it he drew back, 
and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. a look of joy came 
into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. 
he stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that hallward 
was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. 
the sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. 
he had never felt it before. basil hallward's compliments had seemed 
to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. 
he had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. 
they had not influenced his nature. then had come lord henry 
wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning 
of its brevity. that had stirred him at the time, and now, 
as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full 
reality of the description flashed across him. yes, there would 
be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim 
and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. 
the scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from 
his hair. the life that was to make his soul would mar his body. 
he would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth. 
as he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him 
like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. 
his eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist 
of tears. he felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon 
his heart. 
"don't you like it?" cried hallward at last, stung a little 
by the lad's silence, not understanding what it meant. 
"of course he likes it," said lord henry. "who wouldn't like it? 
it is one of the greatest things in modern art. i will give you 
anything you like to ask for it. i must have it." 
"it is not my property, harry." 
"whose property is it?" 
"dorian's, of course," answered the painter. 
"he is a very lucky fellow." 
"how sad it is!" murmured dorian gray with his eyes still fixed upon 
his own portrait. "how sad it is! i shall grow old, and horrible, 
and dreadful. but this picture will remain always young. 
it will never be older than this particular day of june. 
. . . if it were only the other way! if it were i who was 
to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! 
for that-for that-i would give everything! yes, there is 
nothing in the whole world i would not give! i would give my soul 
for that!" 
"you would hardly care for such an arrangement, basil," cried lord 
henry, laughing. "it would be rather hard lines on your work." 
"i should object very strongly, harry," said hallward. 
dorian gray turned and looked at him. "i believe you would, basil. 
you like your art better than your friends. i am no more to you 
than a green bronze figure. hardly as much, i dare say." 
the painter stared in amazement. it was so unlike dorian to speak like that. 
what had happened? he seemed quite angry. his face was flushed and his 
cheeks burning. 
"yes," he continued, "i am less to you than your ivory hermes or your 
silver faun. you will like them always. how long will you like me? 
till i have my first wrinkle, i suppose. i know, now, that when one 
loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. 
your picture has taught me that. lord henry wotton is perfectly right. 
youth is the only thing worth having. when i find that i am growing old, i 
shall kill myself." 
hallward turned pale and caught his hand. "dorian! dorian!" he cried, 
"don't talk like that. i have never had such a friend as you, and i shall 
never have such another. you are not jealous of material things, are you?- 
you who are finer than any of them!" 
"i am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. 
i am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. 
why should it keep what i must lose? every moment that passes 
takes something from me and gives something to it. oh, if it 
were only the other way! if the picture could change, 
and i could be always what i am now! why did you paint it? 
it will mock me some day-mock me horribly!" the hot tears 
welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself 
on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he 
was praying. 
"this is your doing, harry," said the painter bitterly. 
lord henry shrugged his shoulders. "it is the real dorian gray- 
that is all." 
"it is not." 
"if it is not, what have i to do with it?" 
"you should have gone away when i asked you," he muttered. 
"i stayed when you asked me," was lord henry's answer. 
"harry, i can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, 
but between you both you have made me hate the finest 
piece of work i have ever done, and i will destroy it. 
what is it but canvas and colour? i will not let it come across 
our three lives and mar them." 
dorian gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and 
tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table 
that was set beneath the high curtained window. what was he doing there? 
his fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, 
seeking for something. yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin 
blade of lithe steel. he had found it at last. he was going to rip up 
the canvas. 
with a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over 
to hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end 
of the studio. "don't, basil, don't!" he cried. "it would be murder!" 
"i am glad you appreciate my work at last, dorian," said the painter coldly 
when he had recovered from his surprise. "i never thought you would." 
"appreciate it? i am in love with it, basil. it is part of myself. 
i feel that." 
"well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, 
and sent home. then you can do what you like with yourself." 
and he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. 
"you will have tea, of course, dorian? and so will you, harry? 
or do you object to such simple pleasures?" 
"i adore simple pleasures," said lord henry. "they are 
the last refuge of the complex. but i don't like scenes, 
except on the stage. what absurd fellows you are, both of you! 
i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. 
it was the most premature definition ever given. man is many things, 
but he is not rational. i am glad he is not, after all- 
though i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. 
you had much better let me have it, basil. this silly boy doesn't 
really want it, and i really do." 
"if you let any one have it but me, basil, i shall never forgive you!" 
cried dorian gray; "and i don't allow people to call me a silly boy." 
"you know the picture is yours, dorian. i gave it to you before it existed." 
"and you know you have been a little silly, mr. gray, and that you 
don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young." 
"i should have objected very strongly this morning, lord henry." 
"ah! this morning! you have lived since then." 
there came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a 
laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small japanese table. 
there was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted 
georgian urn. two globe-shaped china dishes were brought 
in by a page. dorian gray went over and poured out the tea. 
the two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was 
under the covers. 
"let us go to the theatre to-night," said lord henry. 
"there is sure to be something on, somewhere. i have promised 
to dine at white's, but it is only with an old friend, 
so i can send him a wire to say that i am ill, or that i am 
prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement. 
i think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have all 
the surprise of candour." 
"it is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered hallward. 
"and, when one has them on, they are so horrid." 
"yes," answered lord henry dreamily, "the costume of the nineteenth 
century is detestable. it is so sombre, so depressing. sin is the only 
real colour-element left in modern life." 
"you really must not say things like that before dorian, harry." 
"before which dorian? the one who is pouring out tea for us, 
or the one in the picture?" 
"before either." 
"i should like to come to the theatre with you, lord henry," 
said the lad. 
"then you shall come; and you will come, too, basil, won't you?" 
"i can't, really. i would sooner not. i have a lot of work to do." 
"well, then, you and i will go alone, mr. gray." 
"i should like that awfully." 
the painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. 
"i shall stay with the real dorian," he said, sadly. 
"is it the real dorian?" cried the original of the portrait, 
strolling across to him. "am i really like that?" 
"yes; you are just like that." 
"how wonderful, basil!" 
"at least you are like it in appearance. but it will never alter," 
sighed hallward. "that is something." 
"what a fuss people make about fidelity!" exclaimed lord henry. 
"why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. 
it has nothing to do with our own will. young men want to 
be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: 
that is all one can say." 
"don't go to the theatre to-night, dorian," said hallward. 
"stop and dine with me." 
"i can't, basil." 
"why?" 
"because i have promised lord henry wotton to go with him." 
"he won't like you the better for keeping your promises. 
he always breaks his own. i beg you not to go." 
dorian gray laughed and shook his head. 
"i entreat you." 
the lad hesitated, and looked over at lord henry, who was watching 
them from the tea-table with an amused smile. 
"i must go, basil," he answered. 
"very well," said hallward, and he went over and laid down his 
cup on the tray. "it is rather late, and, as you have to dress, 
you had better lose no time. good-bye, harry. good-bye, dorian. 
come and see me soon. come to-morrow." 
"certainly." 
"you won't forget?" 
"no, of course not," cried dorian. 
"and ... harry!" 
"yes, basil?" 
"remember what i asked you, when we were in the garden this morning." 
"i have forgotten it." 
"i trust you." 
"i wish i could trust myself," said lord henry, laughing. "come, mr. gray, 
my hansom is outside, and i can drop you at your own place. good-bye, basil. 
it has been a most interesting afternoon." 
as the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, 
and a look of pain came into his face. 
chapter 3 
at half-past twelve next day lord henry wotton strolled from curzon 
street over to the albany to call on his uncle, lord fermor, 
a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside 
world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit 
from him, but who was considered generous by society as he fed 
the people who amused him. his father had been our ambassador 
at madrid when isabella was young and prim unthought of, 
but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious 
moment of annoyance on not being offered the embassy at paris, 
a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled 
by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good english 
of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure. 
the son, who had been his father's secretary, had resigned along 
with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, 
and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set 
himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art 
of doing absolutely nothing. he had two large town houses, 
but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, 
and took most of his meals at his club. he paid some attention 
to the management of his collieries in the midland counties, 
excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that 
the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman 
to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth. 
in politics he was a tory, except when the tories were in office, 
during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack 
of radicals. he was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, 
and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. 
only england could have produced him, and he always said 
that the country was going to the dogs. his principles 
were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for 
his prejudices. 
when lord henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough 
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over the times. 
"well, harry," said the old gentleman, "what brings you out so early? 
i thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible 
till five." 
"pure family affection, i assure you, uncle george. i want to get 
something out of you." 
"money, i suppose," said lord fermor, making a wry face. 
"well, sit down and tell me all about it. young people, 
nowadays, imagine that money is everything." 
"yes," murmured lord henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; 
"and when they grow older they know it. but i don't want money. 
it is only people who pay their bills who want that, uncle george, 
and i never pay mine. credit is the capital of a younger son, 
and one lives charmingly upon it. besides, i always deal with 
dartmoor's tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me. 
what i want is information: not useful information, of course; 
useless information." 
"well, i can tell you anything that is in an english blue book, 
harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. 
when i was in the diplomatic, things were much better. 
but i hear they let them in now by examination. what can 
you expect? examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning 
to end. if a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, 
and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad 
for him." 
"mr. dorian gray does not belong to blue books, uncle george," 
said lord henry languidly. 
"mr. dorian gray? who is he?" asked lord fermor, knitting his bushy 
white eyebrows. 
"that is what i have come to learn, uncle george. or rather, 
i know who he is. he is the last lord kelso's grandson. 
his mother was a devereux, lady margaret devereaux. 
i want you to tell me about his mother. what was she like? 
whom did she marry? you have known nearly everybody 
in your time, so you might have known her. i am very much 
interested in mr. gray at present. i have only just 
met him." 
"kelso's grandson!" echoed the old gentleman. "kelso's grandson! ... of 
course.... i knew his mother intimately. i believe i was at her christening. 
she was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, margaret devereux, and made 
all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow- 
a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something 
of that kind. certainly. i remember the whole thing as if it 
happened yesterday. the poor chap was killed in a duel at spa a few 
months after the marriage. there was an ugly story about it. 
they said kelso got some rascally adventurer, some belgian brute, 
to insult his son-in-law in public-paid him, sir, to do it, paid him- 
and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. 
the thing was hushed up, but, egad, kelso ate his chop alone at the club 
for some time afterwards. he brought his daughter back with him, i was told, 
and she never spoke to him again. oh, yes; it was a bad business. 
the girl died, too, died within a year. so she left a son, did she? 
i had forgotten that. what sort of boy is he? if he is like his mother, 
he must be a good-looking chap." 
"he is very good-looking," assented lord henry. 
"i hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man. 
"he should have a pot of money waiting for him if kelso 
did the right thing by him. his mother had money, too. 
all the selby property came to her, through her grandfather. 
her grandfather hated kelso, thought him a mean dog. 
he was, too. came to madrid once when i was there. egad, i was 
ashamed of him. the queen used to ask me about the english noble 
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. 
they made quite a story of it. i didn't dare show my face at court 
for a month. i hope he treated his grandson better than he did 
the jarvies." 
"i don't know," answered lord henry. "i fancy that the boy will be well off. 
he is not of age yet. he has selby, i know. he told me so. and . . . his 
mother was very beautiful?" 
"margaret devereux was one of the loveliest creatures i ever saw, harry. 
what on earth induced her to behave as she did, i never could understand. 
she could have married anybody she chose. carlington was mad after her. 
she was romantic, though. all the women of that family were. 
the men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful. 
carlington went on his knees to her. told me so himself. she laughed at him, 
and there wasn't a girl in london at the time who wasn't after him. 
and by the way, harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your 
father tells me about dartmoor wanting to marry an american? ain't english 
girls good enough for him?" 
"it is rather fashionable to marry americans just now, uncle george." 
"i'll back english women against the world, harry," said lord fermor, 
striking the table with his fist. 
"the betting is on the americans." 
"they don't last, i am told," muttered his uncle. 
"a long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase. 
they take things flying. i don't think dartmoor has a chance." 
"who are her people?" grumbled the old gentleman. "has she got any?" 
lord henry shook his head. "american girls are as clever at concealing 
their parents, as english women are at concealing their past," he said, 
rising to go. 
"they are pork-packers, i suppose?" 
"i hope so, uncle george, for dartmoor's sake. i am told 
that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in america, 
after politics." 
"is she pretty?" 
"she behaves as if she was beautiful. most american women do. 
it is the secret of their charm." 
"why can't these american women stay in their own country? 
they are always telling us that it is the paradise for women." 
"it is. that is the reason why, like eve, they are so excessively 
anxious to get out of it," said lord henry. "good-bye, uncle george. 
i shall be late for lunch, if i stop any longer. thanks for giving me 
the information i wanted. i always like to know everything about my 
new friends, and nothing about my old ones." 
"where are you lunching, harry?" 
"at aunt agatha's. i have asked myself and mr. gray. 
he is her latest protege." 
"humph! tell your aunt agatha, harry, not to bother me any more with 
her charity appeals. i am sick of them. why, the good woman thinks 
that i have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads." 
"all right, uncle george, i'll tell her, but it won't have any effect. 
philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. it is their 
distinguishing characteristic." 
the old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant. 
lord henry passed up the low arcade into burlington street and turned his 
steps in the direction of berkeley square. 
so that was the story of dorian gray's parentage. 
crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him 
by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. 
a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. 
a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, 
treacherous crime. months of voiceless agony, and then 
a child born in pain. the mother snatched away by death, 
the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and 
loveless man. yes; it was an interesting background. 
it posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were. behind every 
exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. 
worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow. 
. . . and how charming he had been at dinner the night before, 
as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure 
he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades 
staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. 
talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. 
he answered to every touch and thrill of the bow. . . . there 
was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. 
no other activity was like it. to project one's soul into some 
gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's 
own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added 
music of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into 
another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: 
there was a real joy in that-perhaps the most satisfying 
joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, 
an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common 
in its aims.... he was a marvellous type, too, this lad, 
whom by so curious a chance he had met in basil's studio, 
or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. 
grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such 
as old greek marbles kept for us. there was nothing that one 
could not do with him. he could be made a titan or a toy. 
what a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! 
. . . and basil? from a psychological point of view, 
how interesting he was! the new manner in art, the fresh 
mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely 
visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; 
the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen 
in open field, suddenly showing herself, dryadlike and not afraid, 
because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened 
that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; 
the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, 
refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though 
they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect 
form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! 
he remembered something like it in history. was it not plato, 
that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it? 
was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles 
of a sonnet-sequence? but in our own century it was strange. 
. . . yes; he would try to be to dorian gray what, without knowing it, 
the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. 
he would seek to dominate him-had already, indeed, 
half done so. he would make that wonderful spirit his own. 
there was something fascinating in this son of love and 
death. 
suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. he found that he had 
passed his aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back. 
when he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they 
had gone in to lunch. he gave one of the footmen his hat and stick 
and passed into the dining-room. 
"late as usual, harry," cried his aunt, shaking her head at him. 
he invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat 
next to her, looked round to see who was there. dorian bowed 
to him shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure 
stealing into his cheek. opposite was the duchess of harley, 
a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked 
by every one who knew her, and of those ample architectural 
proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described 
by contemporary historians as stoutness. next to her sat, 
on her right, sir thomas burdon, a radical member of parliament, 
who followed his leader in public life and in private life 
followed the best cooks, dining with the tories and thinking 
with the liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule. 
the post on her left was occupied by mr. erskine of treadley, 
an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen, 
however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained 
once to lady agatha, said everything that he had to say 
before he was thirty. his own neighbour was mrs. vandeleur, 
one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, 
but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly 
bound hymn-book. fortunately for him she had on the other 
side lord faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, 
as bald as a ministerial statement in the house of commons, 
with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner 
which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, 
that all really good people fall into, and from which none of them 
ever quite escape. 
"we are talking about poor dartmoor, lord henry," cried the duchess, 
nodding pleasantly to him across the table. "do you think he will really 
marry this fascinating young person?" 
"i believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, duchess." 
"how dreadful!" exclaimed lady agatha. "really, some one should interfere." 
"i am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an american 
dry-goods store," said sir thomas burdon, looking supercilious. 
"my uncle has already suggested pork-packing sir thomas." 
"dry-goods! what are american dry-goods?" asked the duchess, 
raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb. 
"american novels," answered lord henry, helping himself to some quail. 
the duchess looked puzzled. 
"don't mind him, my dear," whispered lady agatha. "he never means anything 
that he says." 
"when america was discovered," said the radical member- 
and he began to give some wearisome facts. like all people 
who try to exhaust a subject, he exhausted his listeners. 
the duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption. 
"i wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all!" 
she exclaimed. "really, our girls have no chance nowadays. it is 
most unfair." 
"perhaps, after all, america never has been discovered," 
said mr. erskine; "i myself would say that it had merely 
been detected." 
"oh! but i have seen specimens of the inhabitants," answered the 
duchess vaguely. "i must confess that most of them are extremely pretty. 
and they dress well, too. they get all their dresses in paris. 
i wish i could afford to do the same." 
"they say that when good americans die they go to paris," 
chuckled sir thomas, who had a large wardrobe of humour's 
cast-off clothes. 
"really! and where do bad americans go to when they die?" 
inquired the duchess. 
"they go to america," murmured lord henry. 
sir thomas frowned. "i am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against 
that great country," he said to lady agatha. "i have travelled all over it 
in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil. 
i assure you that it is an education to visit it." 
"but must we really see chicago in order to be educated?" 
asked mr. erskine plaintively. "i don't feel up to the journey." 
sir thomas waved his hand. "mr. erskine of treadley has the world on 
his shelves. we practical men like to see things, not to read about 
them. the americans are an extremely interesting people. they are 
absolutely reasonable. i think that is their distinguishing 
characteristic. yes, mr. erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. i 
assure you there is no nonsense about the americans." 
"how dreadful!" cried lord henry. "i can stand brute force, but brute 
reason is quite unbearable. there is something unfair about its use. 
it is hitting below the intellect." 
"i do not understand you," said sir thomas, growing rather red. 
"i do, lord henry," murmured mr. erskine, with a smile. 
"paradoxes are all very well in their way... ." rejoined the baronet. 
"was that a paradox?" asked mr. erskine. "i did not think so. 
perhaps it was. well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. 
to test reality we must see it on the tight rope. when the verities 
become acrobats, we can judge them." 
"dear me!" said lady agatha, "how you men argue! i am sure i never can make 
out what you are talking about. oh! harry, i am quite vexed with you. 
why do you try to persuade our nice mr. dorian gray to give up the east end? 
i assure you he would be quite invaluable. they would love his playing." 
"i want him to play to me," cried lord henry, smiling, and he looked 
down the table and caught a bright answering glance. 
"but they are so unhappy in whitechapel," continued lady agatha. 
"i can sympathize with everything except suffering," 
said lord henry, shrugging his shoulders. "i cannot sympathize 
with that. it is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. 
there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy 
with pain. one should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, 
the joy of life. the less said about life's sores, 
the better." 
"still, the east end is a very important problem," remarked sir thomas 
with a grave shake of the head. 
"quite so," answered the young lord. "it is the problem of slavery, 
and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves." 
the politician looked at him keenly. "what change do you propose, then?" 
he asked. 
lord henry laughed. "i don't desire to change anything in england 
except the weather," he answered. "i am quite content with 
philosophic contemplation. but, as the nineteenth century has 
gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, i would 
suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight. 
the advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, 
and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional." 
"but we have such grave responsibilities," ventured mrs. vandeleur timidly. 
"terribly grave," echoed lady agatha. 
lord henry looked over at mr. erskine. "humanity takes itself too seriously. 
it is the world's original sin. if the caveman had known how to laugh, 
history would have been different." 
"you are really very comforting," warbled the duchess. 
"i have always felt rather guilty when i came to see your 
dear aunt, for i take no interest at all in the east end. 
for the future i shall be able to look her in the face without 
a blush." 
"a blush is very becoming, duchess," remarked lord henry. 
"only when one is young," she answered. "when an old woman 
like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. ah! lord henry, 
i wish you would tell me how to become young again." 
he thought for a moment. "can you remember any great error 
that you committed in your early days, duchess?" he asked, 
looking at her across the table. 
"a great many, i fear," she cried. 
"then commit them over again," he said gravely. "to get back one's youth, 
one has merely to repeat one's follies." 
"a delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "i must put it into practice." 
"a dangerous theory!" came from sir thomas's tight lips. 
lady agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. 
mr. erskine listened. 
"yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life. 
nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, 
and discover when it is too late that the only things one never 
regrets are one's mistakes." 
a laugh ran round the table. 
he played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into 
the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; 
made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. 
the praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, 
and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad 
music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained 
robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a bacchante over the hills 
of life, and mocked the slow silenus for being sober. 
facts fled before her like frightened forest things. 
her white feet trod the huge press at which wise omar sits, 
till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves 
of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, 
dripping, sloping sides. it was an extraordinary improvisation. 
he felt that the eyes of dorian gray were fixed on him, 
and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was 
one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give 
his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination. 
he was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. he charmed 
his listeners out of themselves, and they followed 
his pipe, laughing. dorian gray never took his gaze 
off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing 
each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his 
darkening eyes. 
at last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in 
the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting. 
she wrung her hands in mock despair. "how annoying!" she cried. "i must go. 
i have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting 
at willis's rooms, where he is going to be in the chair. if i am late he is 
sure to be furious, and i couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. it is far 
too fragile. a harsh word would ruin it. no, i must go, dear agatha. 
good-bye, lord henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. 
i am sure i don't know what to say about your views. you must come and dine 
with us some night. tuesday? are you disengaged tuesday?" 
"for you i would throw over anybody, duchess," said lord henry with a bow. 
"ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so mind you come"; 
and she swept out of the room, followed by lady agatha and the other ladies. 
when lord henry had sat down again, mr. erskine moved round, 
and taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm. 
"you talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?" 
"i am too fond of reading books to care to write them, mr. erskine. 
i should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely 
as a persian carpet and as unreal. but there is no literary public 
in england for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. 
of all people in the world the english have the least sense of the beauty 
of literature." 
"i fear you are right," answered mr. erskine. "i myself used 
to have literary ambitions, but i gave them up long ago. 
and now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call 
you so, may i ask if you really meant all that you said to us 
at lunch?" 
"i quite forget what i said," smiled lord henry. "was it all very bad?" 
"very bad indeed. in fact i consider you extremely dangerous, 
and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you 
as being primarily responsible. but i should like to talk to you 
about life. the generation into which i was born was tedious. 
some day, when you are tired of london, come down to treadley and expound 
to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable burgundy i am 
fortunate enough to possess." 
"i shall be charmed. a visit to treadley would be a great privilege. 
it has a perfect host, and a perfect library." 
"you will complete it," answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow. 
"and now i must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. i am due at 
the athenaeum. it is the hour when we sleep there." 
"all of you, mr. erskine?" 
"forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. we are practising for an english academy 
of letters." 
lord henry laughed and rose. "i am going to the park," 
he cried. 
as he was passing out of the door, dorian gray touched him on the arm. 
"let me come with you," he murmured. 
"but i thought you had promised basil hallward to go and see him," 
answered lord henry. 
"i would sooner come with you; yes, i feel i must come with you. 
do let me. and you will promise to talk to me all the time? 
no one talks so wonderfully as you do." 
"ah! i have talked quite enough for to-day," said lord henry, smiling. 
"all i want now is to look at life. you may come and look at it with me, 
if you care to." 
chapter 4 
one afternoon, a month later, dorian gray was reclining in a luxurious 
arm-chair, in the little library of lord henry's house in mayfair. 
it was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled 
wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling 
of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk, 
long-fringed persian rugs. on a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette 
by clodion, and beside it lay a copy of les cent nouvelles, bound for 
margaret of valois by clovis eve and powdered with the gilt daisies 
that queen had selected for her device. some large blue china jars 
and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small 
leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer 
day in london. 
lord henry had not yet come in. he was always late on principle, 
his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. 
so the lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers 
he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition 
of manon lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases. the 
formal monotonous ticking of the louis quatorze clock annoyed him. 
once or twice he thought of going away. 
at last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. 
"how late you are, harry!" he murmured. 
"i am afraid it is not harry, mr. gray," answered a shrill voice. 
he glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. "i beg your pardon. 
i thought-" 
"you thought it was my husband. it is only his wife. 
you must let me introduce myself. i know you quite well 
by your photographs. i think my husband has got seventeen 
of them." 
"not seventeen, lady henry?" 
"well, eighteen, then. and i saw you with him the other 
night at the opera." she laughed nervously as she spoke, 
and watched him with her vague forget-me-not eyes. 
she was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if 
they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. 
she was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion 
was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. 
she tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. 
her name was victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going 
to church. 
"that was at lohengrin, lady henry, i think?" 
"yes; it was at dear lohengrin. i like wagner's music better than 
anybody's. it is so loud that one can talk the whole time without 
other people hearing what one says. that is a great advantage, 
don't you think so, mr. gray?" 
the same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, 
and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell 
paper-knife. 
dorian smiled and shook his head: "i am afraid i don't think so, 
lady henry. i never talk during music-at least, during good music. 
if one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation." 
"ah! that is one of harry's views, isn't it, mr. gray? 
i always hear harry's views from his friends. it is the only 
way i get to know of them. but you must not think i don't 
like good music. i adore it, but i am afraid of it. 
it makes me too romantic. i have simply worshipped pianists- 
two at a time, sometimes, harry tells me. i don't know what it 
is about them. perhaps it is that they are foreigners. 
they all are, ain't they? even those that are born 
in england become foreigners after a time, don't they? 
it is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art. 
makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it? you have never been 
to any of my parties, have you, mr. gray? you must come. 
i can't afford orchids, but i share no expense in foreigners. 
they make one's rooms look so picturesque. but here is harry! 
harry, i came in to look for you, to ask you something- 
i forget what it was-and i found mr. gray here. 
we have had such a pleasant chat about music. we have quite 
the same ideas. no; i think our ideas are quite different. 
but he has been most pleasant. i am so glad i've seen 
him." 
"i am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said lord henry, elevating his dark, 
crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile. 
"so sorry i am late, dorian. i went to look after a piece of old brocade 
in wardour street and had to bargain for hours for it. nowadays people know 
the price of everything and the value of nothing." 
"i am afraid i must be going," exclaimed lady henry, 
breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. 
"i have promised to drive with the duchess. good-bye, mr. gray. 
good-bye, harry. you are dining out, i suppose? so am i. perhaps i 
shall see you at lady thornbury's." 
"i dare say, my dear," said lord henry, shutting the door behind her as, 
looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, 
she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni. 
then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa. 
"never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, dorian," he said 
after a few puffs. 
"why, harry?" 
"because they are so sentimental." 
"but i like sentimental people." 
"never marry at all, dorian. men marry because they are tired; 
women, because they are curious: both are disappointed." 
"i don't think i am likely to marry, harry. i am too much in love. 
that is one of your aphorisms. i am putting it into practice, 
as i do everything that you say." 
"who are you in love with?" asked lord henry after a pause. 
"with an actress," said dorian gray, blushing. 
lord henry shrugged his shoulders. "that is a rather commonplace debut." 
"you would not say so if you saw her, harry." 
"who is she?" 
"her name is sibyl vane." 
"never heard of her." 
"no one has. people will some day, however. she is a genius." 
"my dear boy, no woman is a genius. women are a decorative sex. 
they never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. 
women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men 
represent the triumph of mind over morals." 
"harry, how can you?" 
"my dear dorian, it is quite true. i am analysing women at present, 
so i ought to know. the subject is not so abstruse as i thought it was. 
i find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, 
the plain and the coloured. the plain women are very useful. 
if you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely 
to take them down to supper. the other women are very charming. 
they commit one mistake, however. they paint in order to try and look young. 
our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. 
rouge and esprit used to go together. that is all over now. 
as long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, 
she is perfectly satisfied. as for conversation, there are only five 
women in london worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into 
decent society. however, tell me about your genius. how long have you 
known her?" 
"ah! harry, your views terrify me." 
"never mind that. how long have you known her?" 
"about three weeks." 
"and where did you come across her?" 
"i will tell you, harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it. 
after all, it never would have happened if i had not met you. 
you filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. 
for days after i met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. 
as i lounged in the park, or strolled down piccadilly, i used 
to look at every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, 
what sort of lives they led. some of them fascinated me. 
others filled me with terror. there was an exquisite poison in the air. 
i had a passion for sensations. . . . well, one evening about seven 
o'clock, i determined to go out in search of some adventure. 
i felt that this grey monstrous london of ours, with its myriads of people, 
its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, 
must have something in store for me. i fancied a thousand things. 
the mere danger gave me a sense of delight. i remembered what you 
had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, 
about the search for beauty being the real secret of life. 
i don't know what i expected, but i went out and wandered eastward, 
soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black 
grassless squares. about half-past eight i passed by an absurd 
little theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. 
a hideous jew, in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld 
in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. 
he had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre 
of a soiled shirt. 'have a box, my lord?' he said, when he saw me, 
and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility. 
there was something about him, harry, that amused me. 
he was such a monster. you will laugh at me, i know, but i 
really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. to 
the present day i can't make out why i did so; and yet if i hadn't- 
my dear harry, if i hadn't-i should have missed the greatest 
romance of my life. i see you are laughing. it is horrid of 
you!" 
"i am not laughing, dorian; at least i am not laughing at you. 
but you should not say the greatest romance of your life. 
you should say the first romance of your life. you will 
always be loved, and you will always be in love with love. 
a grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. 
that is the one use of the idle classes of a country. 
don't be afraid. there are exquisite things in store for you. 
this is merely the beginning." 
"do you think my nature so shallow?" cried dorian gray angrily. 
"no; i think your nature so deep." 
"how do you mean?" 
"my dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really 
the shallow people. what they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, 
i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. 
faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life 
of the intellect-simply a confession of failure. faithfulness! 
i must analyse it some day. the passion for property is in it. 
there are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid 
that others might pick them up. but i don't want to interrupt you. 
go on with your story." 
"well, i found myself seated in a horrid little private box, 
with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. 
i looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house. 
it was a tawdry affair, all cupids and cornucopias, like a 
third-rate wedding-cake. the gallery and pit were fairly full, 
but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was 
hardly a person in what i suppose they called the dress-circle. 
women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a 
terrible consumption of nuts going on." 
"it must have been just like the palmy days of the british drama." 
"just like, i should fancy, and very depressing. i began to wonder 
what on earth i should do when i caught sight of the play-bill. 
what do you think the play was, harry?" 
"i should think 'the idiot boy', or 'dumb but innocent'. 
our fathers used to like that sort of piece, i believe. 
the longer i live, dorian, the more keenly i feel that whatever 
was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. in art, 
as in politics, les grandperes ont toujours tort." 
"this play was good enough for us, harry. it was romeo and juliet. 
i must admit that i was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing shakespeare 
done in such a wretched hole of a place. still, i felt interested, 
in a sort of way. at any rate, i determined to wait for the first act. 
there was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young 
hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, 
but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began. 
romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky 
tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. mercutio was almost 
as bad. he was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced 
gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. 
they were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it 
had come out of a country-booth. but juliet! harry, imagine a girl, 
hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, 
a small greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were 
violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose. 
she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life. 
you said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, 
mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. i tell you, harry, i could 
hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. 
and her voice-i never heard such a voice. it was very low at first, 
with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's ear. 
then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a 
distant hautboy. in the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy 
that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. 
there were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. 
you know how a voice can stir one. your voice and the voice of 
sibyl vane are two things that i shall never forget. when i close 
my eyes, i hear them, and each of them says something different. 
i don't know which to follow. why should i not love her? 
harry, i do love her. she is everything to me in life. 
night after night i go to see her play. one evening she is rosalind, 
and the next evening she is imogen. i have seen her die in the gloom 
of an italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover's lips. 
i have watched her wandering through the forest of arden, 
disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. 
she has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, 
and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. 
she has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have 
crushed her reedlike throat. i have seen her in every age and in 
every costume. ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. 
they are limited to their century. no glamour ever transfigures them. 
one knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. 
one can always find them. there is no mystery in any of them. they ride 
in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. 
they have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. 
they are quite obvious. but an actress! how different an actress is! 
harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an 
actress?" 
"because i have loved so many of them, dorian." 
"oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces." 
"don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. there is an extraordinary 
charm in them, sometimes," said lord henry. 
"i wish now i had not told you about sibyl vane." 
"you could not have helped telling me, dorian. all through your life 
you will tell me everything you do." 
"yes, harry, i believe that is true. i cannot help telling you things. 
you have a curious influence over me. if i ever did a crime, i would come 
and confess it to you. you would understand me." 
"people like you-the wilful sunbeams of life-don't commit crimes, dorian. 
but i am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. and now tell me- 
reach me the matches, like a good boy-thanks-what are your actual relations 
with sibyl vane?" 
dorian gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. 
"harry! sibyl vane is sacred!" 
"it is only the sacred things that are worth touching, dorian," 
said lord henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. 
"but why should you be annoyed? i suppose she will belong 
to you some day. when one is in love, one always begins by 
deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. 
that is what the world calls a romance. you know her, at any rate, 
i suppose?" 
"of course i know her. on the first night i was at the theatre, 
the horrid old jew came round to the box after the performance was over 
and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. 
i was furious with him, and told him that juliet had been dead 
for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble 
tomb in verona. i think, from his blank look of amazement, 
that he was under the impression that i had taken too much champagne, 
or something." 
"i am not surprised." 
"then he asked me if i wrote for any of the newspapers. 
i told him i never even read them. he seemed terribly disappointed 
at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics 
were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were every 
one of them to be bought." 
"i should not wonder if he was quite right there. but, on the other hand, 
judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all expensive." 
"well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means," 
laughed dorian. "by this time, however, the lights were being 
put out in the theatre, and i had to go. he wanted me to try 
some cigars that he strongly recommended. i declined. 
the next night, of course, i arrived at the place again. 
when he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that i 
was a munificent patron of art. he was a most offensive brute, 
though he had an extraordinary passion for shakespeare. 
he told me once, with an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies 
were entirely due to 'the bard,' as he insisted on calling him. 
he seemed to think it a distinction." 
"it was a distinction, my dear dorian-a great distinction. 
most people become bankrupt through having invested too 
heavily in the prose of life. to have ruined one's self over 
poetry is an honour. but when did you first speak to miss 
sibyl vane?" 
"the third night. she had been playing rosalind. 
i could not help going round. i had thrown her some flowers, 
and she had looked at me-at least i fancied that she had. 
the old jew was persistent. he seemed determined to take me behind, 
so i consented. it was curious my not wanting to know her, 
wasn't it?" 
"no; i don't think so." 
"my dear harry, why?" 
"i will tell you some other time. now i want to know about the girl." 
"sibyl? oh, she was so shy and so gentle. there is something of a 
child about her. her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when i 
told her what i thought of her performance, and she seemed quite 
unconscious of her power. i think we were both rather nervous. 
the old jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, 
making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at 
each other like children. he would insist on calling me 'my lord,' 
so i had to assure sibyl that i was not anything of the kind. 
she said quite simply to me, 'you look more like a prince. 
i must call you prince charming.'" 
"upon my word, dorian, miss sibyl knows how to pay compliments." 
"you don't understand her, harry. she regarded me merely as a person 
in a play. she knows nothing of life. she lives with her mother, 
a faded tired woman who played lady capulet in a sort of magenta 
dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen 
better days." 
"i know that look. it depresses me," murmured lord henry, 
examining his rings. 
"the jew wanted to tell me her history, but i said it did not interest me." 
"you were quite right. there is always something infinitely mean 
about other people's tragedies." 
"sibyl is the only thing i care about. what is it to me 
where she came from? from her little head to her little feet, 
she is absolutely and entirely divine. every night of my life i 
go to see her act, and every night she is more marvellous." 
"that is the reason, i suppose, that you never dine with me now. 
i thought you must have some curious romance on hand. you have; 
but it is not quite what i expected." 
"my dear harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, 
and i have been to the opera with you several times," said dorian, 
opening his blue eyes in wonder. 
"you always come dreadfully late." 
"well, i can't help going to see sibyl play," he cried, "even if it is 
only for a single act. i get hungry for her presence; and when i think 
of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, 
i am filled with awe." 
"you can dine with me to-night, dorian, can't you?" 
he shook his head. "to-night she is imogen," he answered, 
"and to-morrow night she will be juliet." 
"when is she sibyl vane?" 
"never." 
"i congratulate you." 
"how horrid you are! she is all the great heroines of the world in one. 
she is more than an individual. you laugh, but i tell you she 
has genius. i love her, and i must make her love me. you, who know 
all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm sibyl vane to love me! 
i want to make romeo jealous. i want the dead lovers of the world 
to hear our laughter and grow sad. i want a breath of our passion 
to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. 
my god, harry, how i worship her!" he was walking up and down the room 
as he spoke. hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. he was 
terribly excited. 
lord henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. how different 
he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in basil hallward's studio! 
his nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. 
out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet 
it on the way. 
"and what do you propose to do?" said lord henry at last. 
"i want you and basil to come with me some night and see her act. 
i have not the slightest fear of the result. you are certain to 
acknowledge her genius. then we must get her out of the jew's hands. 
she is bound to him for three years-at least for two years and eight months- 
from the present time. i shall have to pay him something, of course. 
when all that is settled, i shall take a west end theatre and bring 
her out properly. she will make the world as mad as she has 
made me." 
"that would be impossible, my dear boy." 
"yes, she will. she has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, 
in her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me 
that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age." 
"well, what night shall we go?" 
"let me see. to-day is tuesday. let us fix to-morrow. she plays 
juliet to-morrow." 
"all right. the bristol at eight o'clock; and i will get basil." 
"not eight, harry, please. half-past six. we must be there 
before the curtain rises. you must see her in the first act, 
where she meets romeo." 
"half-past six! what an hour! it will be like having a meat-tea, or reading 
an english novel. it must be seven. no gentleman dines before seven. 
shall you see basil between this and then? or shall i write to him?" 
"dear basil! i have not laid eyes on him for a week. 
it is rather horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in 
the most wonderful frame, specially designed by himself, and, 
though i am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole 
month younger than i am, i must admit that i delight in it. 
perhaps you had better write to him. i don't want to see him alone. 
he says things that annoy me. he gives me good advice." 
lord henry smiled. "people are very fond of giving away what they 
need most themselves. it is what i call the depth of generosity." 
"oh, basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit 
of a philistine. since i have known you, harry, i have discovered that." 
"basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him 
into his work. the consequence is that he has nothing left for 
life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. 
the only artists i have ever known who are personally delightful 
are bad artists. good artists exist simply in what they make, 
and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. 
a great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of 
all creatures. but inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. 
the worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. 
the mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets 
makes a man quite irresistible. he lives the poetry that 
he cannot write. the others write the poetry that they dare 
not realize." 
"i wonder is that really so, harry?" said dorian gray, 
putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, 
gold-topped bottle that stood on the table. "it must be, 
if you say it. and now i am off. imogen is waiting for me. 
don't forget about to-morrow. good-bye." 
as he left the room, lord henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began 
to think. certainly few people had ever interested him so much 
as dorian gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else 
caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. 
he was pleased by it. it made him a more interesting study. 
he had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, 
but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him 
trivial and of no import. and so he had begun by vivisecting himself, 
as he had ended by vivisecting others. human life-that appeared 
to him the one thing worth investigating. compared to it there 
was nothing else of any value. it was true that as one watched 
life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could 
not wear over one's face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous 
fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid 
with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. there were poisons 
so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. 
there were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them 
if one sought to understand their nature. and, yet, what a great 
reward one received! how wonderful the whole world became to one! 
to note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional 
coloured life of the intellect-to observe where they met, 
and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, 
and at what point they were at discord-there was a delight in that! 
what matter what the cost was? one could never pay too high a price for 
any sensation. 
he was conscious-and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into 
his brown agate eyes-that it was through certain words of his, 
musical words said with musical utterance, that dorian gray's soul 
had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. 
to a large extent the lad was his own creation. he had made 
him premature. that was something. ordinary people waited till 
life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, 
the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. 
sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, 
which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. 
but now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed 
the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, 
life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, 
or painting. 
yes, the lad was premature. he was gathering his harvest while it 
was yet spring. the pulse and passion of youth were in him, 
but he was becoming self-conscious. it was delightful to watch him. 
with his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to 
wonder at. it was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. 
he was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, 
whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense 
of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses. 
soul and body, body and soul-how mysterious they were! there was 
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. 
the senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. who could 
say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? 
how shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! 
and yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! 
was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? or was the body 
really in the soul, as giordano bruno thought? the separation of spirit 
from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a 
mystery also. 
he began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute 
a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. 
as it was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. 
experience was of no ethical value. it was merely the name men gave to 
their mistakes. moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, 
had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, 
had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed 
us what to avoid. but there was no motive power in experience. 
it was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. all that it 
really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, 
and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, 
and with joy. 
it was clear to him that the experimental method was the only 
method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis 
of the passions; and certainly dorian gray was a subject made 
to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. 
his sudden mad love for sibyl vane was a psychological phenomenon 
of no small interest. there was no doubt that curiosity had much 
to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences, 
yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex passion. 
what there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood 
had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, 
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote 
from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. 
it was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves 
that tyrannized most strongly over us. our weakest motives 
were those of whose nature we were conscious. it often happened 
that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were 
really experimenting on ourselves. 
while lord henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, 
and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner. 
he got up and looked out into the street. the sunset had smitten into 
scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. the panes glowed 
like plates of heated metal. the sky above was like a faded rose. 
he thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was 
all going to end. 
when he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram 
lying on the hall table. he opened it and found it was from dorian gray. 
it was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to sibyl vane. 
chapter 5 
"mother, mother, i am so happy!" whispered the girl, burying her 
face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, 
with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting 
in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained. 
"i am so happy!" she repeated, "and you must be happy, too!" 
mrs. vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her 
daughter's head. "happy!" she echoed, "i am only happy, sibyl, when i 
see you act. you must not think of anything but your acting. 
mr. isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money." 
the girl looked up and pouted. "money, mother?" she cried, 
"what does money matter? love is more than money." 
"mr. isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get 
a proper outfit for james. you must not forget that, sibyl. fifty pounds 
is a very large sum. mr. isaacs has been most considerate." 
"he is not a gentleman, mother, and i hate the way he talks to me," 
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window. 
"i don't know how we could manage without him," answered the elder 
woman querulously. 
sibyl vane tossed her head and laughed. "we don't want him 
any more, mother. prince charming rules life for us now." 
then she paused. a rose shook in her blood and shadowed 
her cheeks. quick breath parted the petals of her lips. 
they trembled. some southern wind of passion swept over her 
and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. "i love him," 
she said simply. 
"foolish child! foolish child!" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer. 
the waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to 
the words. 
the girl laughed again. the joy of a caged bird was in her voice. 
her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed 
for a moment, as though to hide their secret. when they opened, 
the mist of a dream had passed across them. 
thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, 
hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose 
author apes the name of common sense. she did not listen. 
she was free in her prison of passion. her prince, prince charming, 
was with her. she had called on memory to remake him. 
she had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back. 
his kiss burned again upon her mouth. her eyelids were warm with 
his breath. 
then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. 
this young man might be rich. if so, marriage should be thought of. 
against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. 
the arrows of craft shot by her. she saw the thin lips moving, 
and smiled. 
suddenly she felt the need to speak. the wordy silence troubled her. 
"mother, mother," she cried, "why does he love me so much? i know why i 
love him. i love him because he is like what love himself should be. 
but what does he see in me? i am not worthy of him. and yet-why, i 
cannot tell-though i feel so much beneath him, i don't feel humble. 
i feel proud, terribly proud. mother, did you love my father as i love 
prince charming?" 
the elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed 
her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. 
sybil rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. 
"forgive me, mother. i know it pains you to talk about our father. 
but it only pains you because you loved him so much. don't look so sad. 
i am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. ah! let me be happy 
for ever!" 
"my child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. 
besides, what do you know of this young man? you don't 
even know his name. the whole thing is most inconvenient, 
and really, when james is going away to australia, and i have 
so much to think of, i must say that you should have shown 
more consideration. however, as i said before, if he is rich 
"ah! mother, mother, let me be happy!" 
mrs. vane glanced at her, and with one of those false 
theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second 
nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her arms. 
at this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough 
brown hair came into the room. he was thick-set of figure, 
and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement. 
he was not so finely bred as his sister. one would hardly 
have guessed the close relationship that existed between them. 
mrs. vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. 
she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. 
she felt sure that the tableau was interesting. 
"you might keep some of your kisses for me, sibyl, i think," 
said the lad with a good-natured grumble. 
"ah! but you don't like being kissed, jim," she cried. 
"you are a dreadful old bear." and she ran across the room and 
hugged him. 
james vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness. 
"i want you to come out with me for a walk, sibyl. 
i don't suppose i shall ever see this horrid london again. 
i am sure i don't want to." 
"my son, don't say such dreadful things," murmured mrs. vane, taking up 
a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. 
she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. 
it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation. 
"why not, mother? i mean it." 
"you pain me, my son. i trust you will return from australia in a position 
of affluence. i believe there is no society of any kind in the colonies- 
nothing that i would call society-so when you have made your fortune, 
you must come back and assert yourself in london." 
"society!" muttered the lad. "i don't want to know anything about that. 
i should like to make some money to take you and sibyl off the stage. 
i hate it." 
"oh, jim!" said sibyl, laughing, "how unkind of you! 
but are you really going for a walk with me? that will be nice! 
i was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends- 
to tom hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or ned langton, 
who makes fun of you for smoking it. it is very sweet of you 
to let me have your last afternoon. where shall we go? 
let us go to the park." 
"i am too shabby," he answered, frowning. "only swell people go to the park." 
"nonsense, jim," she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat. 
he hesitated for a moment. "very well," he said at last, 
"but don't be too long dressing." she danced out of the door. 
one could hear her singing as she ran upstairs. her little feet 
pattered overhead. 
he walked up and down the room two or three times. then he turned 
to the still figure in the chair. "mother, are my things ready?" 
he asked. 
"quite ready, james," she answered, keeping her eyes on 
her work. for some months past she had felt ill at ease 
when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers. 
her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met. 
she used to wonder if he suspected anything. the silence, 
for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her. 
she began to complain. women defend themselves by attacking, 
just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. 
"i hope you will be contented, james, with your sea-faring life," 
she said. "you must remember that it is your own choice. 
you might have entered a solicitor's office. solicitors are 
a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with 
the best families."
